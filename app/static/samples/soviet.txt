Introduction

Russia are in process of development. The Soviet Union, from its own resources and energies, is creating a wholesome, new, well-ordered life.

The Revolution placed the productive forces of the country directly in the control of the producing population. The social and political structure of the country is modelled to assure this control and to make every citizen an active and conscious participant in the national life. The laws permit no discriminations in respect to sex or racial stock. There is no private ownership in land or natural resources or in any basic thing vital to the life of the country. The individual farmer has his land for use, and he is protected from the evils of speculative land values by the fact that the State holds the only valid title in trust for all the people.

The new economic structure established in the Soviet Union, still in process of evolution, is developing along definite lines.

Production is carried on along the general lines of carefully devised scientific planning, designed to achieve a balanced economy. The highly socialized character of the structure lends itself to this system of economic planning, conducted by a State Planning Commission (Gosplan) whose functions are of the nature of an economic General Staff.

Nearly 90 per cent of the industrial output comes from organizations working under a federal plan of development, responsible to the State through the Supreme Economic Council for efficiency, quality of product and profitable operation, but enjoying within their own spheres a large measure of administrative autonomy. As a whole the record of these industries during the past few years in improved economy, increased labor efficiency and enhanced rationalization is promising. The banks and the credit system are under the control of the State. Transport and communications are run directly by Government departments.

In wholesale trade the State organs play a major part. Many of the larger State trusts or syndicates market their own products direct in this field. In retail trade the cooperatives have the major share, with private traders accounting for only about one-fourth of the turnover, and State organizations about 10 per cent. The share of the cooperatives is growing rapidly and that of the private traders decreasing. Chain stores distribution by the co-operatives is increasingly effective. Foreign trade is a Government monopoly.

In agriculture 98 per cent of the production is the output of individual farmers, but the farmers market the major part of their products through co-operative or State agencies and purchase their seeds and implements through their own cooperative organizations. Over a third of the peasant farms are represented in the agricultural co-operative societies. A significant movement for the further socialization of agriculture has now been instituted. The system of co-operative farms is rapidly expanding and a chain of great grain-producing areas operated directly by the State is being inaugurated with the most modern agricultural methods, greatly extending the present system of model Soviet farms under State operation.

The economic recovery has enabled the Soviet Government to undertake three important projects designed to give a great impetus to the productive forces of the country. These are:

1. The Dnieprostroy hydroelectric development, the largest hydroelectric project in Europe, which will furnish cheap power to a large section of the Southern Mining District in the Ukraine and will extend navigation on the Dnieper River for hundreds of miles. Total cost about $113,500,000. Construction well under way.

2. The Siberian-Turkestan railway, 950 miles, which will bring Siberian grain, timber and minerals to the Soviet cotton belt in Central Asia. Total cost about $100,000,000. Construction under way.

3. The Volga-Don Canal, which will give the Volga, the chief water transport route of the Soviet Union, a direct outlet for exports and imports on the Black Sea. Total cost, $85,000,000. Final plans approved by State Council of Experts, September, [1928].

The rise of the cooperative movement generally has been a natural phenomenon of the socialist State. The various cooperative organizations now have a membership of some 3,000,000. They play an increasing role in the economic scheme, particularly in its distributive phases.

The rise of the labor organizations has been as spectacular as that of the co-operatives and is of even greater significance. The trade unions have over 11,000,000 members. They have taken a leading part, in coOperation with the Government organizations, in the upbuilding of industry and the creation of better efficiency methods. They have likewise figured prominently in the warfare against illiteracy and in the solution of other social problems.

The Soviet Union entered its second decade in a healthy economic condition, with its productive forces strongly on the upgrade. It is still hampered by a lack of basic capital, caused by the enormous destruction of the years of war and civil strife. It is still handicapped by bureaucracy, partly inherited from the past, partly a hangover from the highly centralized administration necessary during the war-time crisis. This is being vigorously combated.

During its second decade the Soviet State looks forward to a greatly increased industrialization together with the development of a comprehensive plan of electric power expansion. Industrial planning envisages the doubling of the output of factories and mines by the close of [1932]. During the five-year period (beginning October I, [1927]) some $3,650,000,000 will be spent, according to the plan, on capital extensions in industry, including $1,500,000,000 for new plants. Agricultural production is expected to increase upwards of 23 per cent during this period. Along with the expansion of industry an extension of the system of granting concessions to foreign interests under limited leaseholds has been outlined. The stability of the country and its great undeveloped natural resources contribute to the possibilities in this line.

The steady growth of education among the masses of the population is expected to prove a prominent factor in increased productivity and the establishment of higher standards of life. At the present rate of progress the inherited scourge of illiteracy should be pretty thoroughly liquidated by the time the second decade is half over.

For the scientist the creation of a new society has opened a much broader opportunity. Advances in both pure and applied science have been marked. Inventions of great value have been forthcoming. Many new scientific institutes have been opened and laboratory equipment greatly improved. The natural resources of the country are being explored and tabulated to an extent hitherto unknown. The scientist has become an important factor in the industrial scheme, with a resultant notable gain in methods and processes.

There is every reason for confidence that the end of the second decade will see the country well advanced towards a full and comprehensive use of its natural resources and a high degree of industrial achievement along advanced technical lines. A substantial start has already been made.

Statistics given in this book are from official sources. Annual figures relate generally to the Soviet fiscal year, which runs from October r to September 30. Statistics given in

former Year Books issued by the Soviet Union Information Bureau have been revised in accordance with later official source material.

Area and Population

THE Union of Soviet Socialist Republics occupies the largest territory of any country in the world, with the exception of the British Empire and all dependencies, the land area is 8,144,228 square miles (21,352,572 square kilometers). The land area of continental United States is less than 3,000,000 square miles.

The population of the U.S.S.R., as of January I, [1928], according to the estimate of the Central Statistical Board, was 149,900,000. According to the census of [1926]-27 it was 147,013,600 at the beginning of [1927]. In [1914] the population of the same territory was 138,200,000.

Under the census of [1926]-27 the population included 71,024,300 men and 75,989,300 women.

The density of population of the U.S.S.R., under the figures of the census of [1926]-27, is 18.1 persons per square mile.

Owing to transfers of heavily populated territories to Poland, Finland and the border states at the close of the World War, the present territory of the Soviet Union is 93 per cent of that of the Tsarist Empire; the population is 82 per cent of that of the former Empire.

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, as established by the Treaty of Union, July 6, [1923], was composed of four constituent republics:

1. The Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic (R.S.F.S.R.). 
2. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. 
3. The Transcaucasian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic. 
4. The White Russian Soviet Socialist Republic.

To these the following were added during [1925]:

5. The Turkoman Soviet Socialist Republic. 
6. The Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic.

These two republics, in Central Asia, were formerly in the territory of the R.S.F.S.R.

Area and Population of Constituent Republics

Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 21,352,572  147,013,600 Moscow
Russian S.F.S.R.

The Russian S.F.S.R. (Soviet Russia proper) contains nearly 70 per cent of the population of the Soviet Union and includes 92 per cent of its territory. The population under the census of December, [1926], was 100,858,000 and the area 19,757,953 square kilometers. Its territories stretch from the Latvian and Finnish borders and the White Russian and Ukrainian lines on the west, to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, and from the Arctic Ocean on the north to the shores of the Black and Caspian seas and the borders of Persia, Afghanistan, Mongolia and Manchuria on the south. It includes forty former provinces of European Russia, three provinces of the Northern Caucasus, the greater part of Siberia and the Far East. Its eleven autonomous republics and thirteen autonomous areas are representative of its principal minor national groups.

White Russian S.S.R.

The White Russian S.S.R. [Byelorussia] was proclaimed January 1, [1919]. [Note: All of these republics were given indepedence after the Soviet Revolution of November, [1917]]

It had a population of 4,983,900 under the census of December, [1926], and an area of 126,792 square kilometers. It occupies six former counties of the Minsk province and parts of the old Smolensk, Vitebsk and Gomel provinces.

Under the Tsars White Russia was a pale of settlement of the persecuted Jewish population. It suffered greatly from periodical pogroms and from inter-racial struggles. Between [1914] and [1920] it was a field for military operations.

The racial composition is: White Russians 72.2 per cent, Russians proper 14.1 per cent, Jews 10.6 per cent, Poles 2 per cent, other nationalities 1.1 per cent.

The country is agricultural, the soil largely marshy and lacking in fertility. The lack of land was so great that the expropriation of the large holdings did not solve the problem. Some 250,000 acres have been added to the farm lands by drainage, and this will be increased to 5,400,000 acres during the next three years.

Principal industries: wood-working, linen, matches, leather, confections, oil pressing, glass, paper, foodstuffs. During the past few years the following industries have made large advances: machine building, knitting, tobacco, optical.

Ukrainian S.S.R.

The Ukrainian S.S.R. is the most densely populated of the Constituent Republics with 19.7 per cent of the population of the Soviet Union in 2 per cent of the area. Under the census of December, [1926], its population was 29,020,300, with an area of 451,731 square kilometers. The Ukrainian S.S.R. was proclaimed in December, [1917], and formed in December, [1919]. It borders on the Black Sea, with Poland and Rumania on its western and southwestern boundary respectively.

Of the total population 80 per cent are Ukrainians, 9.5 per cent Russians, 5.4 per cent Jews, 1.6 per cent Poles, and 3.5 per cent other nationalities: Greeks, Bulgarians, Rumanians, Gypsies, etc. There are also about 5,000,000 Ukrainians living in other portions of the Soviet Union. The city population of the Ukrainian S.S.R. includes 47.5 per cent Ukrainians, 25 per cent Russians, 22.7 per cent Jews. Three-fourths of the schools teach in the Ukrainian language. In respect to occupation 85.2 per cent of the population are farmers, 6 per cent workers, 4.2 per cent office employees, 4.6 per cent in various categories.

The Ukraine contains the famous black soil belt, the chief wheat-producing section of the Soviet Union. Sugar beets and oil seeds are important crops and livestock breeding is rapidly advancing.

In the Donetz Basin the Ukraine has a huge storage of coal, iron and other metals. Here are produced 75 per cent of the coal mined in the country, 70 per cent of the iron and a large proportion of the manganese, and there are heavily developed chemical and dye industries, salt mines, etc. Electric power development is making rapid advances and in the rural districts over 200,000 farms are supplied with current. On the Dnieper River the largest hydroelectric development in Europe is under construction, with an ultimate capacity of 500,000 horsepower.


Transcaucasian S.F.S.R.

The Transcaucasian Republic represents a union of three Soviet Socialist Republics: Azerbaijan, formed April, [1920]; Armenia, formed December, [1920]; and Georgia, formed February, [1921]. In December, [1922], the First Transcaucasian Soviet Congress resulted in the federation of the three in a single Constituent Republic. The population under the census of December, [1926], was 5,850,700 and the area 184,492 square kilometers. Azerbaijan has a population of 2,313,200, capital Baku. Armenia has a population of 875,000, capital Erivan. Georgia has a population of 2,660,900, capital Tiflis. Azerbaijan contains one autonomous republic and Georgia two.

In addition to Armenians, Azerbaijan Turks, Georgians, Russians, Germans, Greeks and Persians, the conglomerate population includes many small nationalities such as Abkhasians, Adjarians, Aisors (Assyrians), Jews, Kurds, Ossetes, Talyshes, Tats, etc. Each of the nationalities maintains its own language, customs and habits. Some of them, like the Georgians and Armenians, have civilizations over a thousand years old, while others until recently have had no written language.

The Tsarist Government played one nationality against the other on the principle of "divide and rule."

Azerbaijan has at Baku the most important oil field in the world; Georgia in Chiaturi possesses the greatest known deposits of manganese. Other industries include copper mining, cotton ginning, silk spinning, leather factories, tanning plants, saw mills, dairies. Many new electrification projects are recently completed or in construction. Newly discovered natural riches include deposits of lead, zinc, silver, asbestos and pumice stone. Cotton is the principal crop.

Uzbek S.S.R. and Turkoman S.S.R.

These two republics in Central Asia were organized in [1924].

The Uzbek S.S.R. had a population of 5,270,200 under the census of December, [1926], and an area of 340,388 square kilometers. The Turkoman S.S.R. had a population of 1,030,500 and an area of 491,216 square kilometers. The area includes a new regrouping of Khiva and Bokhara.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Tsarist Government conquered this territory and suppressed all national independence and culture.

Cotton is the chief crop. Vineyards, fruit orchards and silk growing are also important. Irrigation is a necessity to agriculture and many large projects are under way. The five-year plan calls for an extension of the irrigated area to 3,400,000 dessiatins.

There is a marked development in cotton textile plants, ginning, coal mining, the oil industry, and the salt industry.

Autonomous Republics and Areas

The eleven Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics in the R.S.F.S.R. with their capitals and total populations are as follows:

The divisions and subdivisions among the Constituent Republics of the U.S.S.R. correspond to racial or geographical demarkations. The autonomous republics and areas enjoy the greatest degree of self-government within their domestic spheres. Each has control over its own school system. Each of the several score of nationalities within the Soviet Union has complete freedom to use its own language in written or spoken form, including its use in the courts and schools, and to develop its own peculiar social usages. Compulsory Russification ended with the formation of the Soviet State.

Each constituent republic retains the right of free withdrawal from the Union.

Every citizen of the U.S.S.R. is completely free to conform to any religion or sect, or to none.

Ownership of all land and natural resources rests with the State in trust for all the people. Otherwise private property is recognized in the Civil Code.

Nationalities

The population of the U.S.S.R. is composed of 182 different nationalities, speaking 149 different languages or dialects. Under the census of December, [1926], the following thirty nationalities composed 97.6 per cent of the total population:

Persons Per cent of Total Population

Area and Population

THE Union of Soviet Socialist Republics occupies the largest territory of any country in the world, with the exception of the British Empire and all dependencies, the land area is 8,144,228 square miles (21,352,572 square kilometers). The land area of continental United States is less than 3,000,000 square miles.

The population of the U.S.S.R., as of January I, [1928], according to the estimate of the Central Statistical Board, was 149,900,000. According to the census of [1926]-27 it was 147,013,600 at the beginning of [1927]. In [1914] the population of the same territory was 138,200,000.

Under the census of [1926]-27 the population included 71,024,300 men and 75,989,300 women.

The density of population of the U.S.S.R., under the figures of the census of [1926]-27, is 18.1 persons per square mile.

Owing to transfers of heavily populated territories to Poland, Finland and the border states at the close of the World War, the present territory of the Soviet Union is 93 per cent of that of the Tsarist Empire; the population is 82 per cent of that of the former Empire.

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, as established by the Treaty of Union, July 6, [1923], was composed of four constituent republics:

1. The Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic (R.S.F.S.R.). 
2. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. 
3. The Transcaucasian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic. 
4. The White Russian Soviet Socialist Republic.

To these the following were added during [1925]:

5. The Turkoman Soviet Socialist Republic. 
6. The Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic.

These two republics, in Central Asia, were formerly in the territory of the R.S.F.S.R.

Russian S.F.S.R.

The Russian S.F.S.R. (Soviet Russia proper) contains nearly 70 per cent of the population of the Soviet Union and includes 92 per cent of its territory. The population under the census of December, [1926], was 100,858,000 and the area 19,757,953 square kilometers. Its territories stretch from the Latvian and Finnish borders and the White Russian and Ukrainian lines on the west, to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, and from the Arctic Ocean on the north to the shores of the Black and Caspian seas and the borders of Persia, Afghanistan, Mongolia and Manchuria on the south. It includes forty former provinces of European Russia, three provinces of the Northern Caucasus, the greater part of Siberia and the Far East. Its eleven autonomous republics and thirteen autonomous areas are representative of its principal minor national groups.

White Russian S.S.R.

The White Russian S.S.R. [Byelorussia] was proclaimed January 1, [1919]. [Note: All of these republics were given indepedence after the Soviet Revolution of November, [1917]]

It had a population of 4,983,900 under the census of December, [1926], and an area of 126,792 square kilometers. It occupies six former counties of the Minsk province and parts of the old Smolensk, Vitebsk and Gomel provinces.

Under the Tsars White Russia was a pale of settlement of the persecuted Jewish population. It suffered greatly from periodical pogroms and from inter-racial struggles. Between [1914] and [1920] it was a field for military operations.

The racial composition is: White Russians 72.2 per cent, Russians proper 14.1 per cent, Jews 10.6 per cent, Poles 2 per cent, other nationalities 1.1 per cent.

The country is agricultural, the soil largely marshy and lacking in fertility. The lack of land was so great that the expropriation of the large holdings did not solve the problem. Some 250,000 acres have been added to the farm lands by drainage, and this will be increased to 5,400,000 acres during the next three years.

Principal industries: wood-working, linen, matches, leather, confections, oil pressing, glass, paper, foodstuffs. During the past few years the following industries have made large advances: machine building, knitting, tobacco, optical.

Ukrainian S.S.R.

The Ukrainian S.S.R. is the most densely populated of the Constituent Republics with 19.7 per cent of the population of the Soviet Union in 2 per cent of the area. Under the census of December, [1926], its population was 29,020,300, with an area of 451,731 square kilometers. The Ukrainian S.S.R. was proclaimed in December, [1917], and formed in December, [1919]. It borders on the Black Sea, with Poland and Rumania on its western and southwestern boundary respectively.

Of the total population 80 per cent are Ukrainians, 9.5 per cent Russians, 5.4 per cent Jews, 1.6 per cent Poles, and 3.5 per cent other nationalities: Greeks, Bulgarians, Rumanians, Gypsies, etc. There are also about 5,000,000 Ukrainians living in other portions of the Soviet Union. The city population of the Ukrainian S.S.R. includes 47.5 per cent Ukrainians, 25 per cent Russians, 22.7 per cent Jews. Three-fourths of the schools teach in the Ukrainian language. In respect to occupation 85.2 per cent of the population are farmers, 6 per cent workers, 4.2 per cent office employees, 4.6 per cent in various categories.

The Ukraine contains the famous black soil belt, the chief wheat-producing section of the Soviet Union. Sugar beets and oil seeds are important crops and livestock breeding is rapidly advancing.

In the Donetz Basin the Ukraine has a huge storage of coal, iron and other metals. Here are produced 75 per cent of the coal mined in the country, 70 per cent of the iron and a large proportion of the manganese, and there are heavily developed chemical and dye industries, salt mines, etc. Electric power development is making rapid advances and in the rural districts over 200,000 farms are supplied with current. On the Dnieper River the largest hydroelectric development in Europe is under construction, with an ultimate capacity of 500,000 horsepower.


Transcaucasian S.F.S.R.

The Transcaucasian Republic represents a union of three Soviet Socialist Republics: Azerbaijan, formed April, [1920]; Armenia, formed December, [1920]; and Georgia, formed February, [1921]. In December, [1922], the First Transcaucasian Soviet Congress resulted in the federation of the three in a single Constituent Republic. The population under the census of December, [1926], was 5,850,700 and the area 184,492 square kilometers. Azerbaijan has a population of 2,313,200, capital Baku. Armenia has a population of 875,000, capital Erivan. Georgia has a population of 2,660,900, capital Tiflis. Azerbaijan contains one autonomous republic and Georgia two.

In addition to Armenians, Azerbaijan Turks, Georgians, Russians, Germans, Greeks and Persians, the conglomerate population includes many small nationalities such as Abkhasians, Adjarians, Aisors (Assyrians), Jews, Kurds, Ossetes, Talyshes, Tats, etc. Each of the nationalities maintains its own language, customs and habits. Some of them, like the Georgians and Armenians, have civilizations over a thousand years old, while others until recently have had no written language.

The Tsarist Government played one nationality against the other on the principle of "divide and rule."

Azerbaijan has at Baku the most important oil field in the world; Georgia in Chiaturi possesses the greatest known deposits of manganese. Other industries include copper mining, cotton ginning, silk spinning, leather factories, tanning plants, saw mills, dairies. Many new electrification projects are recently completed or in construction. Newly discovered natural riches include deposits of lead, zinc, silver, asbestos and pumice stone. Cotton is the principal crop.

Uzbek S.S.R. and Turkoman S.S.R.

These two republics in Central Asia were organized in [1924].

The Uzbek S.S.R. had a population of 5,270,200 under the census of December, [1926], and an area of 340,388 square kilometers. The Turkoman S.S.R. had a population of 1,030,500 and an area of 491,216 square kilometers. The area includes a new regrouping of Khiva and Bokhara.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Tsarist Government conquered this territory and suppressed all national independence and culture.

Cotton is the chief crop. Vineyards, fruit orchards and silk growing are also important. Irrigation is a necessity to agriculture and many large projects are under way. The five-year plan calls for an extension of the irrigated area to 3,400,000 dessiatins.

There is a marked development in cotton textile plants, ginning, coal mining, the oil industry, and the salt industry.

Autonomous Republics and Areas

The eleven Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics in the R.S.F.S.R. with their capitals and total populations are as follows:

The divisions and subdivisions among the Constituent Republics of the U.S.S.R. correspond to racial or geographical demarkations. The autonomous republics and areas enjoy the greatest degree of self-government within their domestic spheres. Each has control over its own school system. Each of the several score of nationalities within the Soviet Union has complete freedom to use its own language in written or spoken form, including its use in the courts and schools, and to develop its own peculiar social usages. Compulsory Russification ended with the formation of the Soviet State.

Each constituent republic retains the right of free withdrawal from the Union.

Every citizen of the U.S.S.R. is completely free to conform to any religion or sect, or to none.

Ownership of all land and natural resources rests with the State in trust for all the people. Otherwise private property is recognized in the Civil Code.

Nationalities

The population of the U.S.S.R. is composed of 182 different nationalities, speaking 149 different languages or dialects. Under the census of December, [1926], the following thirty nationalities composed 97.6 per cent of the total population:

Persons Per cent of Total Population

Government

THE U.S.S.R. is an association of Soviet Republics, based on the principle of voluntary centralism.


The Federal Government, representing the peoples within the Union, exercises complete authority in all matters relating to the central administration of the Union, viz., armed defense, foreign relations, transport and communications, political security. The Federal authority also exercises supervision to secure coordination and uniformity in regulations affecting economic matters, labor and the general well-being. Adherence to the Union does not limit the autonomy of the Republics in the field of internal administration.

The basis of the representative system rests upon the Soviets or elective councils.

The Soviet constitution and laws are designed to afford the largest possible degree of autonomy and cultural development for the various national groups. They are free to preserve their distinctive customs, institutions and languages and a national group sufficiently numerous and geographically localized may under authorization form an autonomous republic or area with a full measure of local administrative autonomy.

The Soviets, which are councils of delegates of a working citizenship, are designed to represent directly the productive life of the country. In the cities the basis of representation is mainly occupational, with the exception that persons in unorganized occupations (such as housewives) vote in geographic units. In the rural districts, where the productive life is homogeneous, the basis of representation is geographical.

Each village elects its local Soviet. The various village Soviets send delegates to a township (Volost) Soviet, which elects an executive committee to exercise administrative powers in its jurisdiction.

Similarly in the towns or cities delegates from the various productive groups of the community assemble in the town or city Soviet.

The District Congress of Soviets is composed of delegates from the village Soviets and from the Soviets of urban settlements of above 10,000 inhabitants. The delegates from the village Soviets are on the basis of one to 1,000 inhabitants, and in sparsely settled sections two or more villages may combine to send a delegate. The urban Soviets send one delegate to 200 electors.

The Provincial Congress of Soviets is composed of delegates from Urban Soviets, from Soviets of industrial settlements with a population of 5,000, and from the Volost Soviets.

In this fashion, from the original local or occupational unit, the Soviets pyramid up to the Congresses of Soviets representing the larger administrative divisions, the autonomous republics and areas, the constituent republics, and the entire Soviet Union.

The supreme organ of authority is the All-Union Congress of Soviets. This is composed of representatives of town and township Soviets, and of provincial Congresses of Soviets. It meets at least once in two years.(1)

During the interval between the All-Union Congresses of Soviets, the supreme authority devolves upon the Central Executive Committee, consisting of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities.

The Council of the Union is elected by the Congress from representatives of the six constituent republics, in proportion to their population. It has in all 450 members.

The Council of Nationalities is formed of representatives of the Constituent and Autonomous Republics, five delegates from each, and of representatives of autonomous areas, one delegate from each, in all 139 members. The members of the Council are elected at the Republican and regional congresses of Soviets.

The Central Executive Committee meets three times a year. During the interval between sessions of the Central Executive Committee, the Presidium of the Committee is the supreme legislative, executive, and administrative organ of authority.

The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee consists of 27 members, nine representing the Council of the Union, nine representing the Council of Nationalities and nine elected by the two Councils in joint session.

The Council of People's Commissars is the executive and directive organ of the Central Executive Committee. Members of the Council are elected for two years. The following members of this executive cabinet were serving December 1, [1928]:

Chairman: A. I. Rykov. 
Vice-Chairmen: J. E. Rudzutak, V. V. Schmidt and V. V. Kuybyshev. 
People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs: G. V. Tchitcherin. 
People's Commissar for Army and Navy: K. E. Voroshilov. 
People's Commissar for Transport: J. E. Rudzutak. 
People's Commissar for Posts and Telegraphs; N. K. Antipov. 
People's Commissar for Workers' and Peasants' Inspection: G. K. Ordjonikidze. 
Chairman Supreme Economic Council: V. V. Kuybyshev. 
People's Commissar for Labor: N. A. Uglanov. 
People's Commissar for Trade and Commerce: A. I. Mikoyan. 
People's Commisar for Finances: N. P. Briukhanov. 
Director of Central Statistical Board: V. P. Miliutin.

On the same date the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee had the following six Chairmen: M. I. Kalinin, G. I. petrovsky, A. G. Cherviakov, Gazanfar Mussabekov, Netyrbay Aitakov, and Faizulla Khodzhayev. A. S. Enukidze was Secretary of the Central Executive Committee.

In each of the six Constituent Republics the legislative and administrative scheme is patterned on that of the federal Government. Each has its Congress of Soviets, its Central Executive Committee, and its Council of People's Commissars containing such Commissariats as are relative to the work of a Constituent Republic.

The same general scheme is also repeated in each of the Autonomous Republics, and likewise in the Autonomous Areas except that the latter have no Council of Commissars. In their scheme the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee fulfills the functions of the Council of People's Commissars.

In the Soviet administrative scheme, the People's Commissariats are divided into three categories: Commissariats of the whole Union alone; Commissariats which form part of the administrative scheme of the Constituent Republics, as well as of the Federal Government; Commissariats which appear in the Constituent Republics alone.

Commissariats of the whole Union alone are: Foreign Affairs, Army and Navy, Transport, Posts and Telegraphs, Trade and Commerce. The divisions of Trade and Commerce dealing with the internal trade are also in the Constituent Republics.

Commissariats in both the Federal Government and the Governments of the Constituent Republics are: Supreme Economic Council, Labor, Finance, Workers' and Peasants' Inspection.

Commissariats of the Constituent Republics only: Agriculture, Internal Affairs, Justice, Education, Health, Social Welfare.

The Supreme Court of the Union, attached to the Central Executive Committee, includes in its functions the following:

• To give the Supreme Courts of the Constituent Republics guiding interpretations on federal legislation. 

• To render to the Central Executive Committee opinions on decisions of the Supreme Courts of the Constituent Republics which may seem in contradiction to the general legislation of the Union, or to affect the interests of the other republics. 

• To give opinions, on demand of the Central Executive Committee, on the constitutionality of legislation of the Constituent Republics. 

• To decide legal conflicts between the Constituent Republics. 

• To examine cases of accusation against high officials of the Union.

A pyramidal representative form, similar to that adopted for the entire Union, with local and town Soviets as the base, obtains in each of the six Constituent Republics and in the autonomous republics and areas.

The permanent judicial system was established January 1, [1923]. It includes People's (District) Courts of both civil and criminal jurisdiction, Provincial Courts of Second Instance, Supreme Courts of the Constituent Republics, and the Supreme Court of the Union, subdivided into various courts of special jurisdiction. There are also special Labor Courts, which may be the local People's Court sitting in special session for labor cases. A Civil Code, a Criminal Code, a Land Code and a Labor Code, and Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure, were adopted in November, [1922]. The first Code of Civil Status, defining marriage, family and guardianship rights, was adopted in [1918]; a new code became operative January 1, [1927].

During the period of civil war and foreign intervention the local administration of justice was largely in the hands of revolutionary Tribunals and Special Tribunals. The Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution (Cheka), which was abolished at the close of [1922], had extraordinary jurisdiction in important offenses against public order.

A federal Political Department with broad powers (O.G.P.U.) is attached to the Union Council of People's Commissaries for the purpose of combating political and economic counter-revolution, espionage and banditry. The Union Supreme Court has supervision over the legality of the actions of the O.G.P.U.

Red Army

The supreme organs of military power are the All-Union Congress of Soviets, the Central Executive Committee, the Council of Commissars, and the Council of Labor and Defense.

The All-Union Congress and the Central Executive Committee have the right to declare war and to conclude peace, to ratify war budgets, to supervise the organization and direction of the armed forces. Laws and other measures referring to armed defense are carried out through the Council of Commissars. The Council of Labor and Defense coordinates the action of all the organs concerned in fortifying the country's means of defense.

The Military Revolutionary Council of the Union is the supreme organ of the central military administration. Its chairmanship is vested in the Commissar for Army and Navy; its members are confirmed in their functions by the Council of Commissars. The Military Revolutionary Council is in charge of the immediate direction of land and sea forces in all branches.

The Red Army of the Soviet Union numbers 562,000 men. The strength has held constant since [1924].

Before the war the strength of the peace-time army in Russia was 1,400,000 men. Early in [1914] this was increased to I,800,000 men.

The strength of the Red Army has fluctuated as follows in past years:

[1920]  3,538,000
[1921]  4,110,000
[1922]  1,590,000
[1923]  703,000
[1924]-28   562,000
The social composition of the army is: workers 15 per cent, peasants 75 per cent, other elements 10 per cent.

National composition of the Red Army: Russians proper 64.8 per cent, Ukrainians 17.4 per cent, White Russians 4.2 per cent, Jews 2.1 per cent, Tartars 2 per cent, others 9.5 per cent.[Note: the Red Army was among the first truly multi-racial armies of the world where members from different ethnic groups were treated fairly.]

Less than 10 per cent of the conscripts drawn for the army are now illiterate, as compared with the great majority before the war. All are taught to read and write in the army. The course of training includes a vigorous educational program. By [1927] there were 710 clubs and 9,546 libraries in the Red Army.

Military service is obligatory except for persons of certain categories who are deprived of the right to vote at Soviet elections. For those drawn the service extends over 21 years (between the ages of 19 and 40), though the active service is restricted to from two to four years.

The percentage of the federal budget devoted to military and naval expenditures has decreased steadily in recent years. In the budget of [1926]-27 the percentage for such expenditures, including medical and sanitary work, was 13.9, and in the budget of [1927]-28 the budgetary allotment is 13.4 percent. In the budget of [1913] military and naval expenditures formed 28.2 per cent of the total. The annual military expenditures per capita of the population in the U.S.S.R. is 5.4 rubles.

Marriage Law

The marriage age is 18 years for both men and women. Polygamy is punishable by criminal prosecution. There are stringent regulations concerning the duty of parents to support and rear their children, and parents found to be neglecting their duties may even be deprived of their rights as parents, and of their children. Unmarried mothers are entitled to support for their offspring on proving paternity. Parents and society have the same duties and obligations to children born in or out of wedlock.

Divorces may be secured from the proper authorities by mutual consent. If one of the parties to the marriage enters an objection, court proceedings are held. Alimony is payable to either party to the marriage (husband or wife) if incapacitated for work. There are rigid requirements for the care of the children.

Under the revised marriage code of [1926] so-called common-law marriage was made legal.

The following table gives figures for marriages and divorces for the European part of R.S.F.S.R., and for the Ukraine and White Russia, per 1,000 of the population:

[1911]-13   [1925]  [1926]
Marriages   Divorces (2)    Marriages   Divorces    Marriages   Divorces
European part of R.S.F.S.R. 8.2 ....    9.8 1.5 10.6    1.5
Ukraine 8.3 ....    10.6    1.8 9.8 1.4
WhiteRussia 7.4 ....    10.5    1.3 9.9 1.6
Soviet Democracy

Through various organizations, official, economic and civic, it is estimated that between 9,000,000 and 10,000,000 persons are actively engaged in the administration of the Soviet Union. The organization of society is designed to give public activities the broadest scope and to give the greatest possible number of the population the opportunity for active participation in their direction.

A total of 1,539,458 citizens were serving in [1927] as elected delegates to the various Soviets (local, township, provincial, republican and federal). Thus over a million and a half citizens, nearly 2.5 per cent of the total adult population, form part of the administrative machinery of the country. From io to 12 per cent of these delegates are women. In addition to these elected delegates upwards of a million workers and peasants take part in the activities of the various committees, commissions, circles and other bodies organized by the Soviets for the purpose of investigation, study and supervision of various branches of Soviet activities.

The trade unions have upwards of 11,000,000 members, of whom approximately a million and a half serve as members of factory committees or sub-committees or as factory and office delegates. These trade union committeemen and delegates play an important role in shaping the industrial process, in solving problems of production and in cultural and educational activities.

The cooperative societies have 35,000,000 members, of whom 500,000 have an active part in conducting the distributive and productive work of these organizations, which have an increasing importance in the economic life of the country.

The 1,400,000 members of the Communist Party form the most active element in the country, taking the leadership in productive and cultural advance. Close behind stand the League of Communist Youth, with 2,000,000 members between the ages of 16 and 23 years, and the Pioneers, with 1,700,000 members between the ages of 8 and 15. Between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 of these young people are engaged in various public activities.

In addition various voluntary societies, with aggregate membership running well above 10,000,000, play an active part in public affairs. These include the Friends of Aviation and Chemical Defense, the Society of Automobiles and Roads, and many others, including local mutual aid societies in the villages and "patronage" societies which "adopt" for cultural or material aid villages or army detachments. The worker and peasant correspondents for the Soviet press, nearly 350,000 in number, also represent a powerful active social factor.

Soviet Foreign Policy

The essentials of Soviet foreign policy have been expressed at the disarmament conference at Geneva in the fall of [1927], at the Economic Conference at Geneva in May, [1927], as well as by formal declarations during recent years by Chairman Rykov of the Council of People's Commissars or by Mr. Tchitcherin, People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, or Mr. Litvinov, Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs. The keynotes of the policy are peace and trade.

Implicit in the foreign policy is the thesis that the economic and social system, as established in the Soviet Union, and the systems existing in other countries, can exist peaceably side by side, and that the Soviet Union and other countries can cooperate in trade and economic development. This thesis was fully outlined by the Soviet delegates to the Economic Conference at Geneva and was formally accepted by the delegates from other countries.

The trend of Soviet foreign policy was further indicated at the disarmament conference held at Geneva in March, [1928], at which Mr. Litvinov, on behalf of the Soviet Government, presented a plan for immediate complete disarmament by all countries. When the other parties to the conference showed a disinclination to accept this plan as a basis of discussion, Mr. Litvinov presented an alternative plan providing for progressive partial disarmament.

When the Soviet Government came into power in [1917], it addressed a proposal to all countries for an immediate peace without annexations or indemnities.

On November 1, [1917], the Soviet Government proclaimed the right of self-determination for those nations which are constituent parts of the old Russian Empire. On November 22, the Government issued a manifesto renouncing the colonial policy of previous Russian Governments. About this time it inaugurated its policy against secret treaties by publishing the secret treaties and understandings of previous Russian Governments. The special privileges and territorial holdings exacted from China by previous Russian Governments were formally renounced. This renunciation was later embodied in the treaty between the U.S.S.R. and China concluded in [1924].

The early manifestos of the Soviet Government relating to the peoples of the East inaugurated its Eastern policy of self-determination for these peoples and of adherence to their right to selfdevelopment unhindered by foreign interference. This policy has been maintained without change.

Initial attempts of the U.S.S.R. to establish normal diplomatic relations with other countries came to success slowly. A period of invasions financed from abroad intervened. In [1918] Allied armies established bases at such widely separated points as Vladivostok and Archangel and pressed into the interior. For a brief period British troops succeeded the TurcoGerman forces in the Baku oil regions. The "independent" Government, originally established under German auspices in Georgia, became an "independent" Government operating under Allied auspices, this in territory containing the richest manganese mines in the world and other mineral wealth. An economic blockade of Soviet Russia was established. This continued more or less after the invasions were ended and the civil wars had been liquidated. During the early years foreign policy was in large measure a matter of dayto-day expediency in a nation wholly absorbed in a desperate struggle to keep alive.

As the civil conflicts subsided, in [1920], the western border states began to establish diplomatic relations. Afghanistan, Persia and Turkey did likewise. Germany, which had been linked by close economic ties with the old Empire, followed. A trade agreement was concluded with Great Britain. In [1922] the Soviet Government took part in the international conferences at Genoa and The Hague. In [1924] de jure recognition was accorded by Great Britain, Italy, Norway, Austria, Greece, Danzig, Sweden, China, Denmark, Mexico and France, in the order given.

In August, [1924], a General Treaty and a Trade Treaty were drawn up and signed with the MacDonald Government in England. Chapter VI of the General Treaty provided a settlement of all questions concerning claims of debt. The Baldwin Government, which shortly afterwards succeeded the MacDonald Government, did not ratify these treaties.

For several years negotiations have been conducted with successive French Governments in regard to the debts of the former Tsarist Government held in France. Both in the summer of [1926] and the fall of [1927] the discussions appeared to approach a settlement, but on each occasion they broke down. The negotiations are still open and an active resumption of the conversations may be anticipated.

During recent years the Soviet Government has pressed the idea of helping to secure peace by the making of neutrality and non-aggression pacts with its neighbors. It concluded such pacts with Germany, Turkey, Lithuania and Afghanistan by [1926]. A similar treaty was signed with Persia in [1927].

Among other border countries the progress of negotiations has been somewhat retarded by hostile alien influences, but progress is being made.

By [1926] the development of relations with other countries had made decided progress. In Germany a credit of 300,000,000 marks for Soviet trade was established under the auspices of the German Government. In the spring of [1927] a similar trade credit amounting to 10,000,000 pounds sterling, was in process of arrangement by the Midland Bank in England. Shortly before this credit was to be announced the offices of Arcos, the Soviet trade organization in London, were raided and subsequently the British Government broke off diplomatic relations. A campaign against normal diplomatic relations with the U.S.S.R. had preceded this raid for some weeks. It began early in the year after the breaking off of a conference between representatives of the Soviet Oil Syndicate and representatives of foreign oil interests. At the conference formulas were being worked out for the distribution of the rapidly growing oil exports of the Soviet Union. The conference broke up over the insistence of Sir Henri Deterding, representing Royal Dutch-Shell, on a monopoly of Soviet oil exports and a limitation of Soviet exports of crude oil.

No other country followed the British lead in breaking relations. The only permanent result of the incident was a decided shift in Soviet trade. The bulk of Soviet orders ordinarily placed in England were transferred to Germany and the United States. There was, however, little decrease of Soviet sales in England.

The incident had no effect on the general foreign policy of the Soviet Government of building peaceful and cooperatively profitable relations with other countries. The policy of leasing concessions to foreign interests for limited periods is being developed and expanded.

The Kellogg multilateral pact on the renunciation of war was signed in Paris August 27, [1928], by the original signatories representing Germany, Belgium, the United States, France, Great Britain and her Dominions, Italy, Japan, Poland and CzechoSlOvakia. Two days later the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the U.S.S.R., in a special resolution, authorized Mr. Litvinov, Acting People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, to sign the Pact in Paris, and likewise voted adherence to the Pact. On December 29, Mr. Litvinov, in a note to the Polish Government, proposed that the Pact be made effective immediately as between the Government of Poland and the Government of the U.S.S.R. A similar note was sent to the Lithuanian Government.

NATURAL RESOURCES

IN the value of its natural resources the Soviet Union stands first among all countries. Owing to the backwardness of scientific work under the Tsarist régime, these resources are still imperfectly surveyed. The scientific renascence that has followed the Revolution has given a great impetus to exploration and survey work. A complete inventory of the natural resources of the country, begun in a desultory manner under the old régime, is now being prosecuted systematically and through this work new resources are constantly being revealed, and closer estimates of known resources are being reached. Statistics of the natural resources are being constantly revised in the light of the new estimates.

WATER POWER.- The latest estimate of the undeveloped hydraulic resources, as given by the Central Statistical Board, are:

Horse Power
European territory   21,505,000
Asiatic territory    40,875,000
Total   62,380,000
COAL-The coal reserves of the Soviet Union are estimated at 474,673 million metric tons, of which approximately one-eighth is anthracite. Recent estimates of the Geological Committee of the various fields, in millions of metric tons, follow:

Doneta  68,180
Siberia 388,463 (1)
Far East    3,311
Urals and Petchora  792
Central Industrial Region    8,388
Central Asia     5,292
Caucasus and Crimea 247
474,673
PEAT.- Peat reserves are estimated at about 265 billion metric tons.

OIL.- The oil resources of the Soviet Union are the greatest of any country. They are estimated at 2,883,800,000 metric tons. The estimates for the various fields, in millions of metric tons, follow:

Baku    1,442.6
Grozny  900.0
Kuban   65.6
Transcaucasia   32.8
Urals   262.4
Ukhta   32.8
Cheleken    32.8
Ferghana    16.4
Sakhalin    98.4
Total   2,883.8
TIMBER.- The forest area of the Soviet Union covers upwards of two billion acres, much more than the area in the United States and Canada combined. Immense districts are covered with highgrade varieties of cedar, fir, oak, pine, spruce, etc.

POTASH.- The Geological Committee has recently discovered large deposits of potassium salts in the Solikamsk district of the West Ural region. In a surveyed area of four square miles the deposits are estimated at 68,000,000 metric tons. The deposits commence at a depth of 95 meters and go down to a depth of 200 meters. They are thus much more accessible than the deposits in Germany or in French Alsace. The total reserves of the surrounding districts are estimated at from 1,500,000,000 to I,725,000,000 metric tons. Ground was broken for the first mine on November 7, [1927].

IRON-Surveyed deposits of iron ore are estimated, at 2,782,000,000 metric tons, exclusive of the recently surveyed area in the Kursk district where the deposits are estimated at between 20,000,000,000 and 30,000,000,000 tons. Reserves in the most productive section, the Krivoi-Rog district, are estimated at 400,000,000 metric tons. The Kursk deposits occupy a broad area about 200 miles long. They occur at a depth of io meters. The iron content of the ore has been found to be 30 to 52 per cent. The storage here is estimated at more than double all hitherto known European deposits.

MANGANESE.- Recent estimates of the deposits of manganese ore, in thousands of metric tons, follow:

Caucasus (including Chiaturi)   71,525
Ukraine (including Nicopol) 76,395
Urals   833
Asiatic 919
Total   149,672
Rich Copper deposits are found in the Urals, the Caucasus, the Don Basin and various parts of Siberia. Research work in connection with the main copper deposits of the Urals shows reserves of upwards of 7 million tons of copper ore, and the whole reserves of the Urals are estimated at 8 million tons.

Great deposits of Gold occur in several portions of Siberia. The auriferous area of the Aldan fields alone has been shown in recent surveys to cover nearly 1,000 square miles. Thus far the gold resources of the Soviet Union have been exploited only to a small extent. The gold mineral reserves within the localities where operations already exist are estimated at a minimum of 9,900,000 pounds avoirdupois.

Before the war the Platinum deposits of the Urals gave Russia virtually a monopoly in the production of that metal. The industry was paralyzed by the war. It is now gradually being restored.

Reserves of Bauxite in the Soviet Union are estimated at 8,000,000 metric tons.

Deposits of Sulphur at Kerch in the Crimean Peninsula are estimated at 500,000 tons. In September, [1926], an expedition of the Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Scientific Research of the Turkoman Republic located even larger deposits in the Kara-Kum desert. These beds contain several million tons, but are 200 kilometers from the nearest railway. Other deposits are in Daghestan and Transcaucasia.

The Soviet Union also contains large deposits of Silver and Lead ores, Pyrites, Graphite, Phosphate Rock, Chromic Ores,

Salt, Asphalt, Asbestos, Mica, Zinc. Deposits of high grade Uraninite, from which radium is procured, were discovered in the summer of [1925] on the western shore of the White Sea by a geological expedition of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences.

FISH.- The resources of fish in the waters in and about the Soviet Union are enormous, and the fish are of the greatest variety.

FURS.- Furs form one of the principal exports of the U.S.S.R. They come principally from the Asiatic portion. The Siberian, Far Eastern, Kazak and Uzbek regions provide over half of the total annual procurements.

AGRICULTURE

THE position and prospects of the farming population were completely transformed as a result of the Revolution. In pre-war days in European Russia and the Ukraine the peasant was virtually land-starved. He worked the land under a threefield system, each field a separate small strip usually miles away from the other strips. His methods were most primitive and agricultural education was virtually unknown. Usually he was without any general education whatever. The country school was a rarity.

The peasants paid to absentee landlords upwards of $200,000,000 in rentals annually.

The Revolution increased the arable land available for the peasant in European Russia by 30 per cent, and in the Ukraine by over 70 per cent. To-day 96 per cent of the arable land in the Ukraine and from 97 to 99 per cent in Europeai Russia is in the hands of the peasants for use. The cold figures, however, give but an inadequate picture of the change. Under the old regime the favored wealthy peasants, relatively small in number, waxed fat at the expense of the mass of their less fortunate brethren. Like the feudal landlords, they owned the fields of others and controlled marketing resources, and squeezed their poor neighbors at every opportunity. They had become speculators, mortgage holders and middlemen as well as producers. The redistribution of land has deprived them of their privileged position and reduced their holdings to one-tenth of the land formerly in their control. The middle and poorer farmers have been the main beneficiaries of the change and have at last been placed in a position where they can enjoy the fruits of their toil. Moreover the new economic scheme of things favors the poorer farmer. To-day 35 per cent of the farmers are exempt from taxes.

Under the new order the conditions of land tenure have completely changed. There are no private titles in land. The land is held in trust by the State for all the people and is worked by individuals or groups under a system of perpetual leasehold. No land may be held out of use, or sold. A restricted system of private leaseholds has been devised to prevent the loss of land by families temporarily incapacitated. A single agricultural tax-which may be reduced or eliminated for sections suffering from impairment or loss of crops-is the sole charge for the land by the Government. The total agricultural tax in [1927]-28 amounted to $170,000,000.

The redistribution of the land has brought new agricultural problems which are still in process of solution. Though the grain crops of the past four years were close to the pre-war average, less than half the pre-war tonnage of grain was available for the market and the greatly increased consumption both on the farms and in the cities left only a fraction of the pre-war tonnage available for export. The increasing consumption is due not only to the fact that the people have reached a markedly higher level of per capita food consumption than before the war, but also to the fact that the greatly decreased death rate has raised the annual increase of population to 3,000,000 persons.

The grain export situation became particularly acute during the past year.

The explanation of the situation is simple. Before the war half of the annual grain production and practically all the surplus for export came from the large estates and the rich peasants. The rest of the peasants, working on their little strip farms, consumed seven-eighths of their product, and in the bad years starved. Since the redistribution of land, the large private estates are no more and the acreage of the wealthy peasants has been greatly reduced. Some of the former estates are operated by the State as Soviet farms. There were 5,706 Soviet farms in [1927] with an aggregate area of 9,218,000 acres. A total of 375,377 persons cooperated in [1928] in 32,000 collective farms with an aggregate area of approximately 3,200,000 acres. Though the production per acre of the Soviet and co-operative farms was materially greater than that of the peasant farms, they furnished only 1.7 per cent of the total grain crop of the country. These enterprises, plus the product of the wealthy farmers, furnish only oneseventh of the total grain crop. The mass of the middle and poor peasants produce six-sevenths of the crop, but they live better than before the war and consume nearly 90 per cent of their product.

To meet the situation the Soviet Government has instituted a threefold campaign: i. To increase the number of collective farms. 2. To expand greatly the system of Soviet farms. 3. To increase the productivity of peasant farms by improved farm machinery, by better seeds and by the extension of the contract system, whereby groups of farmers or entire villages are supplied with seeds, etc., on condition that they deliver a corresponding amount of grain products.

The plans for the collective farms include increasing their aggregate area to 18,300,000 acres occupied by 4,900,000 persons, during the next five years.

The plans for opening new State farms are elaborate and involve the development of some 15,000,000 acres of unused land during the next five years, to yield an annual crop predicated at 1,800,000 tons of grain. The farms will be operated in large units of from 75,000 to 100,000 acres. Tractors and the latest farm mechanism generally will be utilized. The sum of 1,000,000 rubles was spent on the new farms in [1928].

In addition to the plans for increasing the yield of grain the system of purchasing and distributing has been unified and coordinated by the creation of a Grain Center (Khlebocentr) which operates as a single state organ in the marketing field. The Grain Center replaces a number of State and cooperative organizations that hitherto operated in competition, with more or less duplication and waste. The system of a single Center in the marketing field has been worked out successfully for several years for other farm products such as flax, butter, eggs, etc. Hitherto the State and co-operative organizations operating under a federal plan purchased about 75 per cent of the marketable grain. The remainder has been handled by local co-operatives and by private traders. The role of the private trader has been steadily decreasing.

The tremendous advance of the co-operative movement during the past five years (statistics of which are given elsewhere) has re-enforced the changed position of the farmer resulting from the redistribution of the land. The co-operatives, heavily backed by Government credits, have fostered a system of cooperative credit societies which operate throughout the country and are adapted to the peculiar needs of the local rural economy. With the aid of the co-operatives the middleman and his fat percentage have largely vanished from the rural scene. The co-operatives enable the farmer to market many of his products through his own mediums and to purchase his necessary machinery and implements and stock on liberal credit terms. In this respect the co-operatives bring to the farmer somewhat similar advantages in collective bargaining that the trade unions provide for the urban worker. They also assist him to make a more scientific, as well as a more economic use of his time and labor. They are constantly creating better quality standards for his products, with excellent economic results.

In the production of certain types of technical crops and agricultural or dairy products which require a form of manufacture for the market, the co-operatives have come to hold a dominating position. These organizations are responsible for 92 per cent of the butter placed on the market, 76.5 per cent of the cotton, 76.8 per cent of the tobacco, 6.8 per cent of the peasant tobacco (makhorka), 44.6 per cent of the sugar 31.2 per cent of fodder, 48.8 per cent of starch products, 24.9 per cent of flax. These figures are for [1926].

Though agricultural production is still predominantly individualistic, it is becoming more and more socialized, and in the marketing field collectivist forms are widespread.

Along with the development of co-operative marketing has come a development of the contract system, whereby industrial enterprises provide farmers with seeds, implements and fertilizer and contract for the crop on a given acreage. This system has reached considerable proportions in such crops as sugar beets, cotton, tobacco and flax, which move direct from the field to the factory.

The period of war and civil strife, followed by the famine of [1921]-22, cut the volume of agricultural production by about one-half. Naturally this was less than the drop in industry, which in [1921]-22 fell to i per cent of the pre-war output. In [1922] the cultivated area in the Soviet State was 63 per cent of that of [1913], the gross agricultural production 51.9 per cent. The number of horses had fallen to 65.5 per cent of [1913], cattle to 72 per cent, sheep and goats to 64 per cent, hogs to 45 per cent. The farmers' basic capital in machinery and implements had declined by 40 per cent by [1920] and the available man-power on farms by 30 per cent. Since [1922] there has been a steady recovery. For the past four years the agricultural output has been close to the pre-war average. Livestock, with the exception of horses, had increased above the pre-war figure by [1927]. Horses were 83 per cent of the pre-war figure. On the other hand, the number of tractors in use in the fall of [1928] was 33,000, as compared with less than 500 before the war.

In other respects the system of agriculture is showing improvement. The uneconomic threefield system is being done away with. Rotation of crops is being introduced. Before the war crop rotation was practiced on only 1,000,000 to 2,200,000 acres, to-day it obtains on 31,500,000 acres-one-fifth of the whole cultivated area in the R.S.F.S.R. and is gaining rapidly. Early plowing, deep plowing, the development of fodder sowing, the development of technical seeds and deep-root crops-these things have all come during the past decade. The radio is being utilized to disseminate agricultural education.

The decline of the irrigation system, which set in before the revolution, became acute during the period of civil strife. The irrigated area in Transcaucasia and Turkestan decreased from 4,400,000 hectares to I,500,000 hectares, and the cotton area in particular was reduced to 8 per cent of pre-war. During the past five years a complete recovery has been effected. The area under irrigation in [1927] was greater than before the war and new constructions such as the Dnieper river project will bring water to millions of hectares of arid lands during the next few years.

The farmer lives better than he did before the war. He consumes more of his own products, including meat, eggs and dairy products, and especially wheat. He has far better opportunities for the education of his children. He is a citizen instead of a subject and runs his own show. On the other hand he still has to pay more for clothing and implements than he did before the war.

During a good part of the past ten years he has suffered from the prevalent shortage in manufactured goods. During the past year this shortage has been materially reduced and the price of manufactured goods has moved steadily downward. Production of agricultural machinery and implements during [1927]-28 was materially greater than in [1913].

The Commissariats for Agriculture in the six Constituent Republics and their local organizations have general supervision Dyer agriculture, including forests. The activities of the Cornnissariats include work for improvement of cultures, cattle reeding, methods and soils, financial assistance when needed, veterinary assistance, organizations of irrigation projects and vater supply, combating cattle and plant diseases and parasites, administration of State agricultural enterprises, administration of forest funds and management of forest economy, elaboration and execution of general economic measures in the interest of agriculture and forestry.

The immense area of the Soviet Union includes great diversities of climate and soil. The temperature ranges from the subarctic cold of northern Siberia to the sub-tropical heat of Central Asia. Almost every variety of commercial plant can be grown within the Soviet territory.

About 85 per cent of the population lives by agriculture.

INDUSTRY

INDUSTRIAL production in the U.S.S.R. definitely passed the pre-war level during the fiscal year [The Soviet fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30.] [1926]-27 for the first time since the Revolution. The recovery crowned a steady upward struggle of over five years from the winter of [1921]-22, when, as a result of the World War, the civil struggles and foreign invasions, the output of industry had fallen to i per cent of the output for [1913]. Industrial production for the fiscal year [1927]-28 was approximately 125 per cent of that of [1913]. The recovery has been effected without the aid of a single foreign loan.

During the later years of the reconstruction period the advance in industrial production was particularly rapid. In [1924]-25 the output increased Go per cent over the previous year, in [1925]-26 it showed a gain of 40 per cent over [1924]-25. By the end of [1925]-26 in most instances existing plants and equipment were being utilized to full capacity. Further advances had to be effected largely through new construction and machinery plus greater efficiency. In this respect the year [1926]-27 was a crucial year. However, the increase in production during the year was nearly 20 per cent. During [1927]-28 the increase held close to 23 per cent, as compared with the same period in [1926]-27.

During the past three years considerable sums have been made available for capital improvements and expansion in State industry. During [1925]-26 upwards of $400,000,000 was so spent. During [1926]-27 the expenditure was over $550,000,000. During the year [1927]-28 over $650,000,000 was devoted to this purpose. The figures are exclusive of expenditures for the development of electrification and for new railway construction.

In the above figure for [1928], 60 per cent of the allotment comes from the resources of industry (net profits and depreciation funds), 25 per cent from assignments from the Federal budget, the remainder from long-term loans to industry.

The amounts expended for new construction, equipment and capital repairs in the various industries during the past three years are as follows (in rubles):

[1925]-26   [1926]-27   [1927]-28
Industries  Rubles  Rubles  Rubles

Total   810,990,000 1,090,000,000   1,263,500,000
In dollars the above totals are respectively $417,659,850, $561,350,000 and $650,702,500.

For [1928]-29 the new capital allotments for industry, on preliminary figures, were from $775,000,000 to $850,000,000, including $125,000,000 for the metal industry, $114,000,000 for the oil industry, $112,000,000 for the textile industry and $82,000,000 for the coal industry.

The allotment for [1927]-28 was expended in the following categories: Capital repairs 11 per cent, reequipment 56 per cent, new construction 24 per cent, housing 9 per cent. The percentage allotted for new construction has doubled in the past two years.

In [1927] the Supreme Economic Council published its program for the development of Soviet State industry during the five-year period from October 1, [1927], to October 1, [1932]. The plans call for an expenditure of $3,650,000,000 on capital improvements during the period, including $1,406,000,000 for new plants. The plans contemplate a doubling of the industrial output during the five-year period, with a steady reduction of manufacturing costs and prices.

The investment fund is anticipated to come principally from the profits of State industry and from depreciation funds, which are regularly included in the costs of the industries. The total net profits of State industry for [1926]-27 were upwards of $550,000,000. The depreciation funds are scheduled to yield about $1,500,000,000 during the five years. The State budget will be called on to allot from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000 annually. Long-term loans will make up the balance.

The entire industrial activities of pre-war Russia, exclusive of mining, in the present territory of the Soviet Union, were carried on by approximately 13,000 factory establishments. This figure includes only establishments employing 16 or more workers, excepting establishments employing fewer workers and also using mechanical power. During the war period many of these enterprises were liquidated, merged or reorganized. To-day the number of large enterprises operated directly by the State is estimated at 8,750. Enterprises large and small operated by the State have an output of 90 per cent of the total value of industrial production. Many small industrial establishments are operated by industrial cooperatives or by private enterprise.

The State trusts, which operate as autonomous units for production, are held responsible by the Government through the Supreme Economic Council for results in economy, efficiency, development and profits. There may be several of these trusts operating in a single industry, divided according to geographic or other reasons. Certain trusts may also be responsible only in the Constituent Republic in which they operate. For marketing purposes and for the purchase of raw material and equipment, each individual industry is organized in a syndicate, in which the producing trusts have representation.

The trusts are built chiefly on the horizontal principle, combining industrial units of uniform type. A smaller number are trusts of the vertical type, merging interdependent industrial units in the consecutive phases of the production process.

At present there is a twofold trend in State industry. There is a tendency to give more power and initiative to the management of individual plants and to localize responsibility. A decree issued in [1927] embodied this principle. It was designed to promote productive elasticity and cut down bureaucratic procedure. There is also a second trend towards concentration and mergers, which is resulting in more unified management and reduction of production costs.

Private interests are free to enter the industrial field. Any citizen may start without formality a private enterprise employing not over 20 workers and clerks. Private enterprises employing over 20 persons and not over ioo persons may be opened with the permission of the local authorities. For larger enterprises a special leasing or concession agreement is necessary.

Private concessions for developing the natural resources of the country are operated under leases for a limited period of years (see section under Concessions). Numerous productive enterprises are conducted by cooperative organizations.

Industry is controlled and coordinated by certain specially created Government organs. Chief of these are the Supreme Economic Council and the Council of Labor and Defense.

The functions of the S.E.C. are twofold, both regulatory and directive. Its regulatory activity extends over all industries, State, co-operative and private. It publishes regulations for all industries and exercises a general supervision in accord with the working out of a general industrial policy. In its directive function the S.E.C. exercises a centralized direction over all State industries of federal scope, which include the greater part of the large industries. The S.E.C. exercises control over the Supreme Economic Councils of the six Constituent Republics, which direct industrial enterprises of republican scope, and, through regional and local organs, enterprises of localized activity.

The Council of Labor and Defense includes in its functions the standardization of products, inspections, tests, etc. Its most important activity, that of planning production in all branches along the lines of a scientifically worked out scheme designed to meet the needs of consumption, is exercised through a special organ, Gosplan (the State Planning Commission). Gosplan has become of great importance in the task of achieving a balanced economy. Through its work the country has been able to eliminate waste production and to direct new capital investment along the lines of most urgent need.

Gosplan (with its six coordinated bodies in the Constituent Republics) prepares "control figures" which make it possible to ascertain the main tendencies of economic development and to outline the fundamental lines of economic policy. These "control figures" bearing upon the entire national economy of the U.S.S.R. first appeared in [1925] for the fiscal year [1925]-26. The experiment proved of great value, despite the imperfections inevitable in a first attempt. The figures for [1926]-27 and [1927]-28 represented a solid achievement in economic balance. A general five-year plan of economic development (beginning from October 1, [1927]) has also been worked out.

OIL: The Soviet Union stands third among oil-producing nations. Its output in [1927]-28 was nearly 25 per cent above pre-war production.

For purposes of production the oil industry is mainly conducted by three State Trusts, operating respectively in the fields of Baku, Grozny and Emba. The Oil Syndicate, in which the three trusts have representation, handles the marketing. Before the war the Russian oil industry was hampered materially by uneconomic methods and the clashes of small economic units. Labor conditions were bad and early in the century a series of strikes crippled production. The nationalization of the fields under the new régime brought to the industry cohesion and a rational plan of development, incidentally making possible large economies of operation. Since nationalization the industry has been developed conservatively for the future, rather than for snap profits, and substantial technical improvements have been effected.

During [1926]-27 close to $100,000,000 was spent for new construction, equipment and capital repairs in the industry. A similar sum was allotted for [1927]-28. In Grozny in the early part of [1928] only 0.2 per cent of the output was from wells in operation when the fields were nationalized in [1918]. In Baku the percentage was somewhat higher.

The output for the year increased 17 per cent in [1925]-26, nearly 25 per cent in [1926]-27 and 13 per cent in [1927]-28.

The steady increase in output is shown in the following table:

Year    Metric Tons
[1913]  9,215,911
[1920]  3,893,000
[1921]-22   4,629,000
[1922]-23   5,166,372
[1923]-24   5,942,290
[1924]-25   6,960,600
[1925]-26   8,142,000
[1926]-27   10,184,000
[1927]-28   11,502,000
Production during [1926]-27 was divided among the different fields as follows (in metric tons):

Baku    6,893,000
Grozny  2,956,000
Etnba   252,000
Kuban   83,000
Total   10,184,000
Though the oil output increased nearly 25 per cent in [1926]-27, the average number of workers employed decreased from 37,444 in [1925]-26 to 36,598 in [1926]-27.

New drillings in [1926]-27 were 367,567 meters, as compared with 286,958 meters in [1925]-26 and 185,265 meters in [1924]-25 - a gain of 100 per cent in two years. The drillings for [1926]-27 exceeded by nearly 50 per cent the figure of 249,000 meters in [1914].

Average number of wells in daily operation: [1924]-25, 2,278; [1925]-26, 2,720; [1926]-27, 3,168.

The improved technical condition of the fields as compared with pre-war conditions is notable. Electrification is general whereas only one-fourth of the wells were electrified before the war. Deep pumping is rapidly replacing the old baling method of exploitation. Rotary drilling, virtually unknown before the war, was used for two-thirds of the drilling in Baku and Grozny in [1927]. Hermetic exploitation, unknown before the fields were nationalized, is now in general use, with a resultant great saving in gas and the lighter oils.

During the past few years the refineries at Baku and Grozny have been largely refitted and modernized. They are steadily being enlarged. New refineries are under construction at Batum and Tuapse. New cracking plants are being built at both Batum and Grozny.

Oil refined at Baku and Grozny (metric tons):

[1925]-26   [1926]-27   Per cent increase
Baku    3,481,000   3,988,000   14.9
Grozny  2,148,000   2,642,000   23.0
Total   5,629,000   6,630,000   17.8
Refining operations in [1927]-28 aggregated 8,760,000 metric tons.

The pipe line from Grozny to the Black Sea port of Tuapse, 391 miles, was completed early in November, [1928]. The existing Baku-Batum pipe line is being remodeled to carry crude oil instead of kerosene and an additional pipe line is now under construction.

Oil exports for [1927]-28 were nearly triple those of the year [1913]. The increased exports are attributable to the increased production, combined with the fact that the present population of the U.S.S.R. is 18 per cent less than that of the former Russian Empire in [1912], plus the fact that the spread of electrification has cut down the domestic demand for kerosene. The character of the exports has greatly changed since prewar days. In [1913] kerosene and lubricating oils made up 77.4 per cent of the exports. By [1926]-27 the percentage of kerosene and lubricating oil had fallen to 31.2 per cent, while gasoline nearly equalled both combined.

The Amtorg Trading Corporation of New York, American representatives of the Soviet Naphtha Syndicate, announced in the spring of [1928] that various contracts with the Standard Oil Company of New York and the Vacuum Oil Company had brought the purchases by those corporations of Soviet oil products to about $10,000,000 per year. The oil is used in markets in the Near East.

On January 1, [1928], a contract between the Soviet Naphtha Syndicate and the Spanish Oil Monopoly went into effect whereby the Naphtha Syndicate will supply the Spanish Monopoly with 520,000 tons of Soviet oil products, or about 6o per cent of the requirements of the Monopoly.

Soviet oil exports during recent years:

DOMESTIC TRADE

DOMESTIC trade is handled in the Soviet Union by State, cooperative and private enterprises.

The State trading enterprises consist largely of wholesale trading organizations conducted by State producing organizations (the trusts), and by the organs acting as distributors and purchasers of supplies for the trusts (the syndicates). These organizations conduct over 70 per cent of the State trade. The special State trading organizations, the Gostorgs, organized in the Constituent Republics or on a regional or local basis, also play a considerable role in the scheme of distribution. The Gostorgs purchase goods from agricultural and manufacturing producers and import them from abroad for sale to consumers and retailers. They also make purchases for export. Still other State trading enterprises include the agencies for procuring various agricultural products and other joint stock companies specializing in certain products.

Cooperative trade is handled by the Consumers Cooperatives, the Agricultural Cooperatives and the Handicraft Cooperatives. Their shares of the total co-operative turnover (now about $11,000,000,000 a year) are respectively about 70, 20 and 10 per cent.

Of the total turnover in [1927]-28 the State and co-operative enterprises handled 90.2 per cent, about evenly divided, and private traders 9.8 per cent. For [1926]-27 the figures were respectively 81.8 per cent and 18.2 per cent and for [1925]-26 respectively 77.1 and 22.9 per cent.

The share of the private trader in the total turnover has been steadily decreasing of late years. In wholesale trade the role of the private trader fell to 1.5 per cent of the total in [1927]-28. In retail trade private enterprise accounted for 24.2 per cent of the turnover. The business of the State trading enterprises is conducted largely in the wholesale field. In the retail field the State enterprises, like the private dealers, are yielding ground to the cooperatives. In [1927]-28 the share of the State enterprises in the retail trade was only 13.4 per cent of the total. The co-operatives conducted 62.4 per cent of the retail trade.

The gross trade turnover for [1927]-28, including sales of original producers to jobbing organizations, was 54,130,000,000 rubles ($27,876,950,000), an increase of 20 per cent over the previous year. The gross domestic trade turnover during recent years has been as follows (in rubles):

[1924]-25   25,517,100,000
[1925]-26   38,749,700,000
[1926]-27   45,016,000,000
[1927]-28   54,130,000,000
The figures for retail trade in [1927]-28 were as follows (in rubles):

State   1,795,000,000
Cooperative 8,325,500,000
Private 3,222,000,000
Total   13,345,500,000
NIZHNI-NOVGOROD FAIR.- The annual fair held at NizhniNovgorod is an important and spectacular feature of Soviet internal trade and trade with the Eastern neighbors. The trade turnover at the Fair held in September, [1928], was $154,500,000, of which $17,730,000 represented trade with the Eastern countries. In all 2,050 business organizations participated in the Fair, including 380 foreign firms. Foreign firms represented at the Fair included 263 from Persia, 82 from Western China, 20 from Afghanistan, 9 from Turkey, 3 from Iraq, 2 from Mongolia. Attendance at the Fair was about 200,000 persons.

TRANSPORTATION

THE railways of the Soviet Union in the fiscal year [1926]-27 carried 22 per cent more freight in ton-kilometers than in [1913] and the length of tracks was 30 per cent greater.

The restoration of the railways has been one of the largest asks completed by the Soviet State. During the World War md the civil strife about one-fourth of the total trackage was lestroyed and also 7,762 railway bridges. By the end of [919 there were hardly 4,000 good order locomotives in the ountry. Up to [1922] the traffic carried was less than a third )f the pre-war volume.

The railways are run by the Commissariat for Transport, ave for a few lines built and run by large foreign concesionaries for the purpose of developing their concessions.

The total railway mileage at the close of [1927]-28 was 47,941 miles. It was 47,320 miles at the close of [1926]-27, 2,500 miles in [1917] and 36,500 miles in [1913].

The sums invested for new equipment and new lines during ecent years, and the allotment for [1927]-28, are as follows, in millions of rubles:

New Equipment   New Lines   Total
[1923]-24   54  1   55
[1924]-25   70  17  87
[1925]-26   166 27  193
[1926]-27   190 37  227
[1927]-28   325 65  390
Most important of the new lines now in construction is the Turkestan-Siberian railway, 1,481 kilometers (920 miles) long, which was begun early in [1927]. The road will connect it the cotton-growing regions of Central Asia with the grain producing lands in Siberia. The road will cost $100,000,000. It will be completed in [1931]. At present grain from Siberia has to travel 3,000 kilometers to reach the Central Asian cotton belt. The new line will cut the distance to 1,200 kilometers. The road will also bring timber, coal, iron and other materials to Central Asia. The completion of the road will give a great boom to grain growing in Siberia, and will increase the cotton crops in Turkestan. The annual freight turnover of the new road during its first few years is estimated at 1,410,000 metric tons. Over one-third of the line, about 500 kilometers, was completed by the close of [1928].

During [1927] a somewhat higher schedule of railway rates was placed in operation. The rates are now 143 per cent of those of [1914].

During the past few years the railways have been operated at a profit. The figures, in millions of rubles:

Operating Revenue   Operating Expenditures  Net Profit
[1924]-25    907.6  764.0   143.6
[1925]-26    1,285.8    1,108.0 177.8
[1926]-27   1,491.8 1,264.0 227.8
The following are comparative statistics on passenger am freight traffic:

Passenger Traffic
[1913]   [1924]-25  [1925]-26   [1926]-27
Passengers carried (millions)       211.8   262.7   254.3
Passenger kilometers (millions) 25,220   19,040 23,402  21,953
Freight Traffic
Metric tons (millions)  83.1    116.8   135.9
Ton kilometers (millions)   65,695   47,414 69,184  82,607
The average daily run for freight cars was 79.3 kilometers in [1926]-27 as compared with 75 kilometers in [1913]. Average run for freight locomotives was 129.8 kilometers in [1926]-27, as compared with 119 kilometers in [1913]. Percentage of high power locomotives to total number was 48 per cent in [1926]-27 as compared with 27 per cent in [1913].

Percentage of bad order locomotives in [1926]-27 was 17 per cent, passenger cars 13 per cent, freight cars, per cent. In [1921] the percentages reached respectively 62, 48 and 33.

Average daily freight car loadings:

[1924]-25   17,398
[1925]-26   24,007
[1926]-27   27,868
[1927]-28   31,185
The average make-up of freight trains in [1926]-27 was 94.26 axles; in [1913] it was 78.8 axles.

By the beginning of [1926] the importation of rolling stock virtually ceased. In [1926]-27 the number of new locomotives built in Soviet plants was 364.

Average number workers employed on railway system:

[1923]-24   715,000
[1924]-25   720,000
[1925]-26   840,000
[1926]-27   863,000
Average monthly wages of railway workers, in rubles:

[1923]-24   32.80
[1924]-25   44.50
[1925]-26   60.93
[1926]-27   69.39
Passenger service in respect to speed of trains, comfort, etc., s well up to pre-war standard. Trains are divided into three groups, local, "accelerated" and express, the last-named scheduled to travel at a speed of from o to 6o kilometers an hour. Excess fare of 25 per cent is charged on express trains.

To assist in the financing of new railway lines the Commissariat for Transport was authorized late in [1927] to issue an internal loan of 60,000,000 rubles. The loan bears interest at 9 per cent and is redeemable within five and a half years.

Air TRANSPORT.- Air transport has made great strides in the Soviet Union during the past few years. The progress in aviation has been greatly assisted by the activities of Osoaviakhim, the Soviet Union Air League, which has a membership of 3,500,000.

In [1928], 11,971 kilometers of air routes, for passengers, freight and mail, were in regular operation. The larger cities in the European portion of the Soviet Union are connected by these lines. Others connect the Trans-Siberian railway with remote points, facilitating greatly the transport of passengers and mail. Moscow and Leningrad are linked with the European air services. Lines run to Persia and Afghanistan. A new Moscow-Verkhne-Udinsk-Peking line, projected last year, was deferred because of the unsettled conditions in China.

Regular commercial airplane service was inaugurated in [1922]. The progress year by year is shown in the following table:

Length of lines (kilometers)    Total Flights (kilometers)  Passengers carried  Mail and freight (kilograms)
[1922]  1200    134,000 276 13,750
[1923]  1610    377,710 1,433   27,885
[1924]  4400    541,764 2,618   48,309

[1928]  11,971  2,383,430   8,653   221,700
There are three operating companies: Deruluft, a mixed German-Soviet concern; Dobrolot, and Ukrvozdukhput, the last the Ukrainian State Company.

The eleven principal trunk lines operated by the three companies follow:

Deruluft runs two lines, Moscow to Smolensk, Riga, Koenigsberg and Berlin, and Leningrad to Reval and Riga, with daily service except Sunday.

The Dobrolot has six lines, as follows:

1. Tashkent to Termez, to Dushembe, four times weekly. 
2. Tashkent to Termez, to Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, twice monthly. 
3. Charjui to Khiva, in Turkestan, six days a week. 
4. Frunze to Alma-Ata. four times a week. 
5. Verkhne-Udinsk, in Siberia, to Urga, the capital of Mon;olia, four times a week. 
6. Irkutsk to Yakutsk, twice weekly, a flight of 2,700 kilometers across desolate Northeastern Siberia.

The Ukrvozdukhput runs these three lines:

1. Moscow to Kharkov, to Pyatigorsk, in North Caucasia, six days a week. 
2. Pyatigorsk to Vladikavkaz to Baku on the Caspian Sea, ;ix days a week. 
3. Baku to Pehlevi, a Persian port on the Caspian, to teheran, the capital of Persia, twice weekly.

Rates are low. Deruluft planes transport one between Moscow and Berlin for $70 in twelve hours. The railroad fare, first class, is over $60 for a 42-hour trip. The internal routes are at the same scale or lower.

In the spring of [1929] Dobrolot plans to open regular service in the most extensive Soviet air line yet organized, from Moscow to Irkutsk, about 3,000 miles.

(For data on Water Transport, see section on Merchant Fleet.)

AUTOMOBILE TRANSPORT.- While automobile buses are increasing rapidly in the larger cities of the U.S.S.R., the scarcity of good roads is a handicap to inter-city traffic. The total length of roads suitable for automobile traffic was estimated at o,000 kilometers in [1927]. Most of the older roads are common dirt lanes, unfit for motor cars during most of the year. A movement for the development of modern highways has recently gained great momentum and promises to transform the road situation in the next few years.

There are only 21,000 automobiles in the Soviet Union. By far the greater part of these have been imported. Up to the present time home production of cars has been negligible, though two or three plants, notably the AMO plant in Moscow, have been turning out some motor trucks.

Plans for an intensive development in motor car construction are now under way.

A society, Avtodor (Automobiles and Roads) was organized in Moscow late in [1927] to promote the introduction of more automobiles and the building of better highways. It is conducting a campaign for mass production of automobiles in Soviet plants and discussing methods of financing large scale importations. It is also pushing a comprehensive campaign for the construction of key highways and the spread of bus lines between cities.

It is planned to spend $750,000,000 on highway construction, from federal and local budgets, during the next five years.

The freight turnover of the Soviet ports reached only about half of the pre-war volume in [1926]-27, the decline being due largely to the smaller exports of the bulky grain products.

The great part of the turnover of the ports consists of exports to foreign countries. Exports from the Soviet Union by way of water for the past three years have been as follows:

[1924]-25   [1925]-26   [1926]-27
(in thousands of metric tons)
White Sea and Arctic Ocean  1,069   979 1,437

Only two of the Soviet ports reached a turnover higher than the pre-war. These are the ports of Vladivostok, which is doing considerable exporting of oil cake and of grain products and of beans from Manchuria, and the port of Batum, exporting largely oil products. Murmansk was built during the war.

The turnover of Soviet ports, in comparison with [1913]:

(thousands of metric tons)
[1924]-25    [1925]-26  [1926]-27
Grain   936 2,273   1,703
Oil products    1,323    1,459  2,004
Ores    609 685 716
Coal    231 247 254
The bulk of the turnover of the Black Sea-Azov ports consisted of exports of oil products, grain, ores and coal. The growth of exports of these products from these ports has been as follows:

The principal exports from the Soviet ports on the Pacific Ocean are the Manchurian beans and oil cake. The growth of these exports during the past three years has been as follows:

(thousands of tons)
[1924]-25   [1925]-26   [1926]-27
Beans   595  613    743
Oil Cake     112    673  504
In [1926]-27 four new steamers, with an aggregate capacity of 14,200 tons, were built in the U.S.S.R. During the year [1927]-28 13 steamers with an aggregate capacity of 34,260 tons were completed.

INLAND WATERWAY5.- The Soviet River Fleet in [1926] consisted of 3,323 steamers as against 3,212 in [1924]. Of the total for [1926], 2,599 boats were in operation. Sailing vessels and barges are upwards of io,000. The largest fleet of any of Soviet rivers is that on the Volga, where in [1926] there were 1,604 steamers with indicated power of 300,595.

There were also 2,949 other boats on the Volga with a capacity of 2,285,000 tons. The turnover on the Soviet internal waterways showed the following growth:

Metric tons
[1920]  11,200,000
[1921]  12,200,000
[1922]  13,400,000
[1923]  19,900,000
[1924]  19,600,000
[1925]  24,300,000
[1926]  32,800,000
[1927]  35,000,000
[1928]  37,000,000
The turnover of [1927] amounted to nearly 75 per cent of the pre-war turnover. In [1927] the U.S.S.R. had 88,400,000 km. of navigable waterways, 173,700 km. of rivers suitable for floating logs, and 2,000 km. of artificial waterways.

The Internal Waterways Steamship Co. had at its disposal on January 1, [1927], 2,020 steamers with an indicated power of 460,745, and 3,975 other boats with a capacity of 3,020,685 tons. In [1927] four new steamers, 48 iron barges and 147 other boats were completed in the U.S.S.R.

VOLGA-DON CANAL: Of great importance to the future of water transport is the Volga-Don Canal project, plans for which were approved by the State Council of Experts in [1928]. This canal will give the Volga, the chief inland waterway of the Soviet Union, an outlet into the Black Sea, instead of the landlocked Caspian. In addition to the construction of a canal 100 km. long between Sarepta on the Don and a point near Stalingrad on the Volga, the project involves the creation of a deep-water port at Rostovon-Don, the sluicing of the Don and bringing to a norm the minimum depth of the Volga. The geographic position of Rostov makes it the chief port for the Southern grain-producing region.

THE DNIEPER RIVER PROJECT.- At present the Dnieper River, flowing into the Black Sea, is navigable only to the rapids near Zaporozhye, about 200 miles from its mouth. The completion of the Dnieprostroy hydroelectric plant at Zaporozhye, now well under way, with its dam and canal lock system, will open the river for a further 500 miles for vessels up to 2,000 tons. The improvement will make the vast valley of the Dnieper a tributary to world trade.

ELECTRIFICATION

ELECTRIC power development in the Soviet Union is proceeding under a carefully drawn plan worked out by Government experts in relation to its increasing importance in the general program of industrial advance. Though the comprehensive scheme of development is still in its infancy, much constructive progress has been made, and the use of electrical energy to-day has advanced far beyond the pre-war use. Construction now under way represents the most ambitious program attempted by a European country and includes the largest single hydroelectric development in Europe.

During the fiscal year [1927]-28 production of electrical energy in the Soviet Union amounted to 3,000,000,000 kilowatt hours, triple the pre-war figure. In [1926]-27 the production was 4,112,000,000 kilowatt hours and in [1925]-26 it was 3,248,000,000. Capacity of electric power plants in the country October 1, [1928], was 1,700,000 kilowatts. Under the plan of electric power development now proceeding, the electric power plants will be able to sustain an annual consumption of ten billion kilowatt hours by [1930]-31.

Power plants are of two main types-public utility plants, and factory or mill plants.

The growth of the public utility power plants is shown in the following table:

Fiscal Year Kilowatts
[1917]  394,000
[1922]-23   478,000
[1923]-24   498,183
[1924]-25   538,026
[1925]-26   618,862
[1926]-27   733,655
The rise of electric energy furnished by public utility stations during the past five years is shown in the following table:

Fiscal Year Kilowatt-hours
[1922]-23   905,000,000
[1923]-24   897,000,000
[1924]-25   1,132,000,000
[1925]-26   1,470,000,000
[1926]-27   2,100,000,000
Factory and mill electric plants have shown a similar increase.

The public utility stations in [1926]-27 included 18 large urban and regional plants with an aggregate capacity of 498,635 kilowatts, and 640 local plants with an aggregate capacity of 235,000 kilowatts.

Under the super-power plans now under development in the Soviet Union, the following are some of the principal plants already in operation:

Volkhov hydroelectric plant, near Leningrad. Capacity 6,000 kilowatts. Opened early in [1927].

Shatura plant, 130 kilometers from Moscow. Operates on peat fuel. Capacity 48,000 kilowatts. Opened [1925]. To be increased to 88,000 kilowatts.

Kashira plant in the Moscow district, furnishing power to 32 villages. Capacity 12,o00 kilowatts. Opened October, [1922]. Capacity to be increased to 40,000 kilowatts by the end of [1928] and to 120,000 kilowatts by [1931].

Balakhna plant, on the Volga near Nizhni-Novgorod. Operates on peat fuel. Capacity 20,000 kilowatts. Opened [1925]. Capacity to be increased to 64,000 kilowatts during [1928] and to 86,000 kilowatts in [1930].

Krasny Oktiabr plant near Leningrad. Operates on peat fuel. Capacity 20,000 kilowatts. Opened 7926. To be increased to 110,000 kilowatts.

Shterovka plant in the Donetz Basin. Operates on coal. Capacity 20,000 kilowatts. Opened [1926]. To be increased to 64,000 kilowatts.

The following large plants were begun in [1925]-26, and were approaching completion in [1928]:

Shakhty, in the Donetz Basin, capacity 44,000 kilowatts; Kharkov Central Plant, capacity 44,000 kilowatts; Kiev, capacity 22,000 kilowatts; Saratov, capacity 11,000 kilowatts.

Construction was begun on the following plants during [1927]-28:

Ivanovo-Vosnesensk and Briansk, capacity 44,000 kilowatts each; Osinov (in White Russia), Gisel-Don (near Viadikavkaz in the Caucasus), Rion hydroelectric (Georgia), Dzoraghet hydroelectric (Armenia), Novorossiysk, Krasnodar and Grozny, each to have an eventual capacity of 22,000 kilowatts. The Briansk and Ivanovo-Voznesensk plants will consume peat, the Novorossiysk, Krasnodar and Grozny plants fuel oil.

In addition, industrial plants under construction amount to about 600,000 kilowatts.

One of the larger regional plants placed under construction in [1927] is the Svir hydroelectric station, on the river Svir, 240 kilometers from Leningrad, which will have a capacity of 80,000 kilowatts.

The most ambitious power project under way is the Dnieprostroy hydroelectric plant, work on which was begun in the summer of [1927]. This will be the largest hydroelectric plant in Europe. Its capacity of 800,000 horse-power will be somewhat greater than Muscle Shoals. The plant will feed the southern mining district of the Ukraine with its rich deposits of manganese, nitre, iron and coal, and its large metallurgical and chemical works. In addition the project, with its collateral works, will open the Dnieper River to navigation for hundreds of miles into the interior, and will furnish irrigation to hundreds of thousands of acres of arid land. The Dnieprostroy project will take years to complete and will cost about $113,500,000 Col. Hugh L. Cooper, the creator of Muscle Shoals, is chief consulting engineer and German technicians are also assisting. The plans are wholly the work of Soviet technicians and the work will be financed by the Soviet Government.

During the past five years the Soviet Government has spent about $250,000,000 for large power stations. During [1928]-29 plans call for the expenditure of an additional $100,000,000. To this will be added local expenditures of $50,000,000 for large plants and $30,000,000 for smaller plants, making a total of $180,000,000.

The original plans for superpower development in the Soviet Union were drawn up as early as [1920], under the impulsion of Lenin, who considered electrification an essential foundation in building the Socialist State. From the early days of the Soviet Government the foremost electrical and construction engineers in the country had been at work on them. The plans called for the construction of thirty new regional power plants with a total capacity of 1,000,000 kilowatts during a period of from ten to fifteen years. For several years the carrying out of the plans advanced slowly because of the acute poverty of the country. It has gained momentum rapidly during the past few years.

Electrical power was virtually unknown in the villages before the Revolution. A few of the big land-holders installed small electric plants to serve the needs of their own estates exclusively. The number of such plants at the outbreak of the Revolution was only g, with a total capacity of 1,038 kilowatts. In [1927] the number of rural plants in operation was 858 and their capacity 18,000 kilowatts. During the next five years, according to the electrification plan, upwards ol $50,000,000 will be expended on village plants and their capacity increased to 200,000 kilowatts.

The growth of rural electrification is shown in the following table:

[1913]  [1917]  [1927]
Number of plants    33  75  858
Aggregate capacity (kw.)    712 1,036   18,500
Farms served            89,739
Current used (1,000 kw. h.) 427 622 10,000
The large regional stations are also playing an increasing role in rural electrification. In [1927] they furnished 14 per cent of the current used on farms.

A beginning has been made to applying electric power to agricultural work, especially in relation to such things as threshing machines, flour-mills, fodder cutters, grain cleaning machinery, sawmills, oil pressing plants, etc. During the next few years electrification promises to be a greatly increased factor in the mechanization of agriculture.

FINANCE

CURRENCY: Shortly after the Soviet Revolution the State Bank was nationalized. Subsequently all other banks were nationalized and fused with the State Bank, the joint institution being known as the People's Bank. After the period of civil war, invasion and blockade set in, and wartime communism was inaugurated as a measure of necessity, even this bank ceased to have any function to perform. It was abolished in [1920], and there followed what is known as the "bankless phase" of the Revolution.

All supplies tended to become concentrated in the hands of the Government; industry secured its raw materials, not by purchase, but by direct assignments from the Government out of available stocks, and the population was similarly supplied with essential articles of consumption by a system of universal rationing. Methods of trade were largely superseded and the use of money limited to a very small sphere of commodity exchange. The devaluation of the currency which naturally resulted was intensified by a more or less deliberate attempt to discredit and abolish the use of money altogether by excessive use of the printing press. The process of depreciation did not cease, however, with the reversal of economic policy in April, [1921], when money was restored to its former function. On the contrary, the printing press was worked with even greater intensity, since the exhaustion of civil war and the advanced stage of economic disorganization left the government for the time being with little other source of revenue.

By [1922] the ruble as a unit of reckoning had declined to such an extent as to become practically useless. A new monetary unit was instituted called the "[1922] ruble," equivalent to 10,000 rubles of previous issues. A year had barely elapsed before progressive inflation had rendered even the [1922] ruble too minute in value, and another monetary unit was instituted known as the "[1923] ruble," made equivalent to 100 rubles of the [1922] issue, i.e., one million rubles of previous issues. The [1922] and prior issues were subsequently withdrawn from circulation.

Meanwhile, with the rapid revival of trade and industry, the need for a stable medium of exchange became urgent, and it was primarily to meet this problem that the State Bank of the R.S.F.S.R. (later the State Bank of the U.S.S.R.) was created in November, [1921]. A year later it was empowered to issue its own note, known as the "chervonetz" (equal to ten gold rubles), backed by a reserve of gold and stable foreign currencies. The gold chervonetz contains 119.4826 grains of fine gold, and is equivalent to $5.146. The new note proved to be highly stable, thanks to the cautious issue policy pursued by the bank. As the bank rapidly accumulated stable assets the note issue was expanded and for two years the curious phenomenon was observed of a stable currency circulating side by side with a highly inflated and catastrophically depreciating currency.

Vigorous measures were meanwhile being taken to rehabilitate the State finances and render the use of the printing press unnecessary. This was more or less accomplished in the beginning of [1924]. The [1923]-24 budget was the first to he balanced since the outbreak of the war, and in March, [1924], were passed the decrees constituting the currency reform. These provided for the issue of a new treasury ruble, measured in terms of gold, supplemented by silver and copper coin of pre-war metal content. The State Bank exchanges its own note for ten rubles of the new currency, and this is the rate universally established. By law the total amount of treasury notes normally must not exceed one-half of the amount of chervontzi in circulation.(1) The old depreciated rubles were withdrawn from circulation at the rate of 50,000 rubles of the [1923] pattern (i.e., 50,000,000,000 rubles issued prior to [1922]) for one new ruble.

The present currency system of the U.S.S.R. consists of State Bank notes (backed by a gold reserve and equivalent "hard" cover), treasury notes (limited to one-half the amount of State Bank notes in issue) and silver, copper and bronze coins. Currency in actual circulation, in millions of rubles:

The parity of the gold ruble is 51.4567 cents.

BANKING.- November 16, [1927], marked the sixth anniversary of the inception of the Soviet banking and credit system. The State Bank during its first year enjoyed a virtual monopoly but the rapid economic recovery of the country stimulated the creation of a banking system, which in view of the short interval involved, is of rather remarkable extent and complexity. This system consists of the central banks, such as the State Bank, the Long Term Credit Bank, the Bank for Foreign Trade, the All-Russian Co-operative Bank, the Central Municipal & Building Bank; banks serving specific territories, such as the Central Asiatic Commercial Bank, the Far Eastern Bank, the North Caucasian Commercial Bank, the Ukrainian Co-operative Bank; the numerous municipal banks of the cities; the Central Agricultural Bank with its numerous subordinate regional agricultural banks and agricultural credit societies; the savings banks and the private banks known as Mutual Credit Societies. In all, this system of banks with their branches and agencies (and treasury offices), comprises some 1,500 units, not counting the savings banks which number about 14,500. In this system the State Bank alone has over some g branches.

During [1927]-28 certain reorganizations have been effected in the banking world in the interest of rationalization and efficiency. The gross number of bank branches has been considerably decreased. Several hundred local agencies of the Commissariat for Finance, which had acted as branches of the State Bank, were discontinued, and their functions were taken over by regular branches of the State Bank, the number of which was somewhat increased in the process. (On October I, [1927], the number of branches of the State Bank in operation was 417, on January 1, [1928], the number was 575.)

Incidentally the Bank for Electrification was merged with the Industrial Bank into a single Long Term Credit Bank, a process called forth in the interest of separating long term from short term credit operations and made logical by the expansion of the long term credit operations and the diminution of the short term operations of the two banks. Short term credit operations of the two banks were transferred to the State Bank, which in turn transferred to the new institution long term operations within its sphere.

FOREIGN TRADE

SOVIET foreign trade is a state monopoly. The Government through the Commissariat for Trade regulates export and import operations which are permitted only with special licenses issued by the Commissariat.

The Commissariat, however, does not actually carry on the foreign trade operations itself. Exports and imports are handled in the U.S.S.R. by state trading companies, cooperative societies, industrial organizations and finally concession and mixed (Soviet and foreign capital) enterprises.

In foreign countries sales and purchases are made on behalf of the above organizations by the Trade Delegations of the U.S.S.R. and also, to a limited extent, by special representatives of Soviet trading organizations. In countries where there are no Soviet trade delegations trade with the U.S.S.R. is conducted through corporations with which special arrangements are made. In the United States, in the absence of a trade delegations Soviet trade is handled by the Amtorg Trading Corporation, All-Russian Textile Syndicate, Inc., CentrosojusAmerica, Inc., and SelskosojusAmerica, Inc.

A general export and import plan for the year is prepared in advance by the Commissariat for Trade. In this plan the export possibilities both in regard to agricultural and manufactured products are evaluated and on the basis of the export expectations an import program is drawn up. The import program provides primarily for the needs of various industries, transportation and agriculture. On the basis of the foreign trade plan export and import licenses are granted to organizations in the U.S.S.R., whether state organs, cooperative organizations or private and concession firms.

The principal exporters from the U.S.S.R. last year were the state exporting joint-stock companies (whose stock is owned by various producing organizations), such as Exportkhleb (Grain Export), Lnoexport (Flax Export) and promexport (Industrial Export). These organizations exported across European frontiers alone in [1926]-27 products valued at 264,805,000 rubles. State syndicates and trusts engaged in marketing products both on the domestic and foreign markets (such as, for instance, the Soviet Oil Syndicate) exported goods valued at 166,811,000 rubles, and the Soviet general trading companies, the so-called "Gostorgs" of the Russian and other constituent republics exported goods valued at 127,194,000 rubles. Among other exporters were cooperatives, several foreign firms and mixed companies which are doing a limited export and import business in accordance with special concession agreements and, finally, private parties.

Exports across European frontiers for [1926]-27 and [1925]-26, by groups of exporters:

Private parties 1,522   2,474
Unspecified 3,354   4,068
Total   678,240 589,124
The greater part (over 75 per cent) of imports into the U.S.S.R. in [1926]-27 were brought in by Soviet trusts, syndicates and special joint-stock importing companies. The remainder of the purchases abroad was made for co-operatives, Private and mixed companies and the Gostorgs.

Nearly three-fourths (72.3 per cent) of all purchases abroad for shipment to the Soviet Union were made last year directly by the Soviet trade delegations and by the Amtorg Trading Corporation in the United States and the Yuzhamtorg in Argentina. The remainder was purchased by other organizations abroad such as agencies of the cooperatives and firms purchasing cotton and wool for the Soviet Textile Syndicate. The share of the trade delegations showed an increase over [1925]-26, when it amounted to 57.4 per cent of the total.

Similarly, 65.3 per cent of all sales of Soviet products abroad were handled in [1926]-27 by the Soviet trade delegations in various countries and by the Amtorg Trading Corporation in the United States, while 34.7 per cent of the sales were handled by other organizations, including concessionaires. In [1925]-26 the percentages were 55.5 and 44.5, respectively.

While the license system is generally strictly applied in Soviet foreign trade, several minor exceptions have been made in regard to certain eastern countries. The nationals of these countries are allowed within certain limits to import into the U.S.S.R. raw materials and to export manufactured products, according to specified lists.

The growth of the value of the foreign trade turnover is shown by the following table:

IMPORTS. The principal Soviet imports are cotton, industrial machinery, non-ferrous metals, leather, wool, tea, paper and cardboard, woolen yarn and agricultural machinery. Imports of cotton, machinery and metals play a larger comparative role in the general import scheme than they did before the war, and imports of consumption goods have fallen off.

During [1927]-28 imports of production goods made up 88 per cent of the import total.

AMERICAN-SOVIET TRADE

TRADE between the Soviet Union and the United States has immense possibilities, particularly in regard to American exports. During the Soviet fiscal year [1927]-28 the turnover of Soviet purchases here, and sales of Soviet products shipped to the United States, aggregated about $120,000,000, as compared to $92,600,000 for [1926]-27 and $48,000,000 for [1913]. Soviet-American trade, despite difficulties inherent in the present lack of a trade treaty, is showing a healthy growth.

The United States now furnishes about 23 per cent of Soviet imports and receives 3.5 per cent of Soviet exports. In igi the United States furnished 5.1 per cent of the imports of the Russian Empire and received 0.9 per cent of the exports. In [1913] Germany furnished 42.6 per cent of Russian imports and took 29.8 per cent of the exports. At present the United States is a competitor with Germany for the largest share of the import trade of the Soviet Union. England up to the spring of [1927] stood second to Germany on the Soviet import list. After the Arcos raid and the rupture of relations with the Soviet Union, England dropped to third. Soviet imports from England have decreased by 6 per cent in the past two years.

The principal Soviet exports are grain and other food products, oil, timber and furs. Of these only furs find a large market in the United States. On the other hand the principal Soviet imports are cotton, machinery and non-ferrous metals, for which the United States is a natural market.

Soviet exports to and imports from the United States, according to Soviet customs statistics:

Exports to U. S.    Imports from U. S.
[1913]  $7,290,000  $40,730,000
[1923]-24   4,377,500   49,955,000
[1924]-25   14,471,500  103,618,000 (1)
[1925]-26   15,810,500  62,881,500
[1926]-27   11,962,900  74,998,400
[1927]-28   14,368,500  96,717,000
Trade between the Soviet Union and the United States is handled in the main by four New York corporations, representing Soviet industrial and trading organizations. These firms are:

Amtorg Trading Corporation, 165 Broadway, New York, representatives in the United States of the principal trusts, syndicates, trading agencies and other economic organizations of the U.S.S.R., with the exception of the All-Russian Textile Syndicate and co-operative organizations. During [1927]-28 the Amtorg made purchases in the United States of industrial equipment, agricultural machinery, non-ferrous metals, etc., for shipment to the Soviet Union, to the value of $33,100,000 and sold Soviet products worth over $12,000,000. The firm's purchases for the year showed an increase of 27 per cent.

All-Russian Textile Syndicate, 39 Broadway, New York, representatives of the Soviet AllUnion Textile Syndicate, purchase American cotton for shipment to the Soviet Union. Orders placed in the United States by this firm during [1927]-28 amounted to $54,300,000, an increase of 23 per cent over the previous year.

Centrosoyus-America, 17 Battery Place, New York, representatives of the Union of Consumers' Cooperatives of the U.S.S.R. During [1927]-28 the turnover of this firm was $,8oo,000, of which $3,300,000 represented sales of Soviet products.

Seiskosojus-America, 90 West St., New York, representatives of agricultural producers' co-operatives of the U.S.S.R. During [1927]-28 the firm placed orders in the United States amounting to $5,400,000.

Several American firms deal directly with the Soviet Union by virtue of special agreements with the Soviet government. Among such firms are:

Eitingon-Schild Co. 
Standard Oil Co. of New York 
Lena Goldfields Co. 
Allied American Corporation 
Russian-American Compressed Gas Co.

The principal Soviet purchases in the United States are cotton ($54,300,000 in [1927]-28), agricultural equipment ($15,000,000), industrial machinery ($11,000,000), automotive equipment ($2,700,000) and metals. The principal Soviet sales in the United States are furs, casings, fish products (including caviar), manganese ore, bristles, flax and tow and precious metals.

Purchases of American cotton for Soviet mills have averaged nearly no,000 metric tons annually for the past two years, as compared with less than 75,000 tons for the two previous years. A steadily decreasing amount of this cotton is purchased abroad, through German or British middlemen.

Purchases for the past four Soviet fiscal years, in metric tons:

U. S.   England Germany Total
[1924]-25   66,564  13,325  1,477   81,366
[1925]-26   58,550  6,058   2,274   66,882
[1926]-27   112,348 7,352       119,700
[1927]-28   93,083  1,218   2,699   97,000
South American Trade

Trade between the Soviet Union and South America was inaugurated only in November, [1925], but increased so rapidly that in the Soviet fiscal year [1926]-27, ending September 30, a turnover of $14,852,000 was reached, eight times the prewar figure. The total direct trade between Russia and South America in [1914] amounted to $1,800,000.

By far the greater part of Soviet-South American trade consists of exports of hides, largely from Argentine, to the U.S.S.R. The total purchases in South America for shipment to the Soviet Union for the period of November 1, [1925]

January 1, [1928], amounted to $29,958,972, of which 83 per cent was hides, 9 per cent quebracho, 3.6 per cent wool, 0.7 per cent iodine, and other products 3.7 per cent. Nearly twothirds of the purchases were made in Argentine (61.3 per cent). The share of Uruguay was 16.7 per cent, Brazil 13.9 per cent and other South American countries 8.1 per cent.

Purchases in South America for 26 months ending December 31, [1927], were as follows:

Hide    $24,851,408
Of this, in 
      Argentine 14,817,539
      Uruguay   4,751,439
      Brazil    4,172,137
      Paraguay  1,000,000
      Chile 109,800
Quebracho in Argentine  2,708,090
Wool:   1,078,023
Of this, in 
      Argentine 828,023
      Uruguay   250,000
Iodine: In Chile    200,000
Other Products  1,121,451
Total   $29,958,972
Sales of Soviet products in South America for the corresponding period amounted to $537,536, of which the bulk was veneer ($323,169) and timber ($116,200).

Until the end of [1927] the trade operations in South America were conducted by the South American branch of the Amtorg Trading Corporation. At the close of [1927], however, the yzhamtorg Corporation with a capital of 1,500,000 Argentine pesos was formed at Buenos Aires. The Yuzhamtorg has a branch at Montevideo, Uruguay, and is opening additional branches at Asuncion, Paraguay; Rio Grande, Brazil; Valparaiso, Chile.

For the first time direct shipments of South American products to the Soviet Union were organized. During [1926] and [1927], 24 ships carried 111,000 tons of freight from South America to Soviet ports, Odessa, Leningrad and Murmansk.

American-Russian Chamber of Commerce

The American-Russian Chamber of Commerce, incorporated in [1916] and reorganized in [1926], is composed of American firms interested in trade with the Soviet Union. Since its reorganization it has been actively engaged in promoting economic, commercial and industrial relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.

The Chamber publishes a monthly Bulletin for distribution to members containing first-hand reports from Moscow on trade opportunities in the Soviet Union and on the economic situation.

The Chamber maintains an office in New York and one in Moscow. The Moscow office is in charge of Mr. Charles Hadden Smith, vice-president of the Chamber, an American railway engineer who has spent much time in the Soviet Union during the past ten years. His office maintains contacts with various departments of the Soviet Government.

The Chamber has an arrangement whereby it secures visas for its members desiring to visit the Soviet Union.

The first annual American Year Book and Directory of the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce was to be published early in [1929]. This Year Book was printed in the Russian language and contains information about the United States of value to Russian executives and officials interested in American trade.

The officers and directors of the Chamber are as follows:

American Section of Soviet Trade Body

An American section of the All-Union-Western Chamber of Commerce was organized in Moscow in July, [1928]. The section conducts activities to facilitate the establishment of closer relations between the interested business spheres of both countries, and collaborates to this end with the AmericanRussian Chamber of Commerce.

The executive bureau of the American section is composed of the following: Charles H. Smith, vice-president and Moscow representative of the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Fushman of the Textile Import Company; Mr. Poliakov of the Amtorg Trading Corporation; Mr. A. A. Yazikov of the Central Statistical Board, formerly Chairman of the Special Delegation of the Far Eastern Republic in Washington ([1921]-22); Mr. Friedman of the Chief Administration of the Electrical Industry; Professor Bookspan, Director of the Economic Department of the Chamber; Professor Klinchnikov, and Mr. Pavlov of the Grain Export Company (Exportkhleb). Mr. Perrotet was elected secretary.

American-Soviet Agreements

A number of important agreements concluded during [1928] between American manufacturing and technical organizations and various Soviet trusts marked progressive steps in the growing industrial relations between the two countries.

The most important agreement was that between the International General Electric Company of New York and the Amtorg Trading Corporation. This provides for long-term credit purchases of electrical equipment for an aggregate sum of from $21,000,000 to $26,000,000 over a period of six years. In connection with the contract General Electric is to establish a bureau of technicians in Moscow to maintain first-hand contacts with Soviet electrical problems.

Another agreement, signed between the Radio Corporation of America and the Soviet State Electrotechnical Trust, provides for exchange of patents and information on radio apparatus and for technical assistance from the Radio Corporation.

Other contracts for technical assistance were made during the year with the Sperry Gyroscope Company, and with Professor H. D. Gibbs, who will assist in the development of the aniline industry. Technical assistance contracts with Hugh L. Cooper and Co. of New York, with Stuart, James and Cooke of New York and with the Freyn Engineering Company of Chicago were extended during [1928]. The Owens Bottle Company and the Russian-American Compressed Gas Company have contracts for consulting services, and the Standard Oil Company of New York, under a concession agreement, completed a kerosene treating plant in Baku early in [1928].

In the spring of [1928] it was announced that various contracts with the Standard Oil Company of New York and the Vacuum Oil Company provided for the purchase by these companies of Soviet oil products aggregating $10,000,000 annually.

(1) Including grain and flour valued at $21,500,000 purchased as a result of the poor harvest of [1924] in the Soviet Union.

CONCESSIONS

THE vast undeveloped resources of the Soviet Union and the lack of facilities for full development in certain industrial and constructive lines afford a broad field for the foreign concessionary. The concession policy is being carefully worked out.

Concessions may be secured by responsible foreign interests from the Chief Concessions Committee (18 Malaya Dmitrovka, Moscow), attached to the Council of People's Commissars. As a rule the concessions run for a limited period of years. The concessionary furnishes the capital for development and the "know how." The Government, in addition to the valid lease, usually affords special facilities for transport and for the importation of equipment and materials. Some concessions are in the form of mixed companies, in which the Soviet Government has a participating interest. Some concessions take the form of engaging foreign engineering firms for technical assistance. Concession agreements, which are drawn up jointly by the Chief Concessions Committee and the applicant, must be ratified by the Soviet Government.

For the convenience of firms and individuals interested in obtaining concessions in the U.S.S.R. the Chief Concessions Committee has representatives in the principal European cities (Berlin, London, Paris) who are empowered to conduct preliminary negotiations.

The Amtorg Trading Corporation is the representative of the Chief Concessions Committee in the United States and is empowered to negotiate concession agreements. The Amtorg is in close touch with the Soviet Chief Concessions Committee and has detailed data in regard to a number of concession prospects in the U.S.S.R.

The Amtorg is in a position to supply American business men with complete information in regard to concessions in the U.S.S.R. and has copies of standard concession agreements which will enable prospective concessionnaires to acquaint themselves with the basic provisions of agreements covering various types of concessions in the U.S.S.R.

After the basic conditions have been determined as a result of preliminary negotiations conducted in this country, the final form of the contract is drawn up in Moscow in agreement with the Chief Concessions Committee which in turn presents it for ratification by the Council of People's Commissars.

During the five years ending November 1, [1927], the Committee received a total of 2,211 applications for concessions, of which 35 per cent came from Germany, 10 per cent from British concerns and 954 per cent from American firms.

During the same period 163 concessions were granted, of which 113 are at present in operation.

On June 1, [1928], there were 97 concessions in operation, distributed as follows:

Operating Concessions
(as of June 1, [1928])
Number of Concessionaries from: Concessions
United States   14
Germany 31
England 10
Japan   17
Poland  5
Sweden  5
France  6
Austria 5
Norway  3
Others  11
Total   97
Of the total number of concessions 40 were for mining and manufacturing, 28 for technical services, and 8 were trading concessions.

The capital invested, as of July 1, [1927], in 39 of the total number of concessions (including 5 mining, 20 manufacturing, timber and agricultural and 3 building concessions) is estimated at $30,000,000, amounting to slightly less than one per cent of all capital invested in these industries in the U.S.S.R. The number of workers employed in 27 concession enterprises (including 7 mining and 20 manufacturing concessions) was, on the same date, 19,658.

On October 1, [1927], the balance sheets of seventeen manufacturing enterprises operated through the fiscal year showed net profits of 4,752,000 rubles ($2,447,280), or 35 per cent, on a total invested capital of 13,484,000 rubles ($6,944,000).

RULEs GOVERNING CONCESSlONs.- Concessions may be granted for the construction and operation of factories, mills and mines, for the building of houses and roads, and for the development of forest, mineral and other of the natural resources of the Union. The concessionary may supply the entire capital necessary for the project or may enter into a "mixed" company in conjunction with a Soviet state organization or, in the case of technical advisers, may not be required to invest any capital at all.

Concessionaries engaged in production are usually permitted to dispose freely of their product on the Soviet market and also to export a certain specified proportion. In cases where the concession enterprise produces commodities for which there is a large demand in the U.S.S.R., the concession agreement usually contains a provision giving an option to Soviet organizations for a part or the whole of the output on conditions specified in the agreement.

The concessionary is permitted to export from the country the entire net profit of the enterprise, the transfer of money to be effected through the State Bank of the U.S.S.R. or any other bank in the country.

The policy and the practice of the Soviet Government has been to especially favor concession enterprises which can obtain the needed raw materials and semi-manufactured products within the country. In the event, however, that the required materials are not available in the U.S.S.R., the concessionary is granted the right to import such materials, the quantity and procedure of importing being specified in the concession agreement. In these cases imports are allowed until such time as the production of the required materials is begun in the country. Imports of equipment are usually exempt from customs duties for a specified length of time after the granting of the concession.

In regard to the payment of taxes and duties the concessionary is placed in the same category as similar Soviet enterprises. Exess profits are usually taxed according to a scale specified in the agreement.

One of the principal provisions of concession agreements is that the enterprise employ the most modern production methods.

The life of the concession, depending upon the nature of the industry and the amount of capital invested, is sufficiently long to allow the concessionary to utilize fully the imported equipment and to receive an adequate return on the invested capital. Upon the expiration of the term of the concession, all the concession properties are turned over to the Government without compensation.

Concession agreements, upon ratification by the U.S.S.R., have the power of a special law. The provisions of such agreements cannot be changed by any decrees or rulings of central or local government organs.

In accordance with the existing laws the Government of the U.S.S.R. guarantees that the properties of the concessionary invested in the enterprise are not subject to nationalization, requisition or confiscation. The concessionary is allowed to hire the necessary working staff on the basis of the provisions 0f the Soviet Labor Code and of the collective agreements made with trade unions. The experience of a number of years shows that concessionaries have had no difficulties in hiring and employing labor in the U.S.S.R. The concessionaries are permitted with certain limitations, to bring in foreign skilled workers and higher administrative and technical personnel. The proportion of foreign workers to the total number of workers is set forth in the agreement.

CONCESSION POSSIBILITIES.- In September, [1928], the Soviet Government announced a program of extension and liberalization of the policy of granting concessions to foreigners. The new policy included the importation of construction materials duty free and the simplification of the taxing scheme. In most cases the concessionaries may sell their products on the domestic market on their own terms and may export subject to the laws existing for external trade. The concessionaries may remit their profits abroad at current rates of exchange prevailing in Moscow.

A list of available concessions was submitted, drawn up by Gosplan to fit in with the five-year plan of industrial development. The list included the following:

Eleven concessions for land development, for the growing of cotton, sugar beets, grain and other agricultural products.

Five concessions for the building of railways, some with collateral oil and forest exploitation rights; three for the building of waterways.

Four large concessions for the exploitation of black metals in the Krivoi Rog, Magnetic Mountain, Telbess and Dnieprostroy districts. Sixteen other metallurgical concessions.

Concessions for foreign capital and technical assistance in the construction of a number of industrial plants, including: A tractor works, lathe construction works, tool-making plant, automobile and auto-truck works (xo,000 to 100,000 units per annum), wagon works, aeroengine construction works, agricultural implement plant, shipyard for river tonnage, steam boiler factory, printing machine construction plant, watch and clock factory, typewriter and adding machine plant, factory for dental and surgical instruments, factory for heat and pressure gauges, plant for sugar and distilling machinery, plant for machinery for the silicate industry, another for machinery for the leather industry, another for sawmill equipment, another for machinery for the match industry, plant for making elevators, conveyors, etc., a bicycle factory, plant for roadmaking machinery, plant for railway rolling stock repairs.

Five concessions for production of cement and one for cement machinery.

Three concessions for cellulose, one for rayon silk, one for treatment of flax for the market.

One tannery concession and a multiple concession for production of vegetable extracts used in tanning.

Four concessions for window and bottle glass, two for pharmaceutical and domestic glass.

Concessions in the mining and fuel industries as follows: iron ore (5), copper (5), lead and zinc (4), gold (3), nickel (1), graphite (1), coal (2), oil (5), asbestos (2).

Nineteen forest concessions.

Eight concessions in the electrical industry.

Eleven concessions for the construction of electric power plants, including a hydroelectric plant of 80,000 kw. on the river Svir, and a steam plant of 60,000 kw. near Cheliabinsk in the Urals.

Concessions for housing in crowded urban centers.

Public service concessions in over sixty cities and towns, including tramways, gas works, electric plants, waterworks, sewers, slaughter houses, etc. The aggregate investment involved is over 2OO,000,oco. The cities in the list include Moscow, Leningrad, Odessa, Kharkov, Tiflis, Kiev, Tashkent, Vladivostok, Novosibirsk, Sverdlovsk and Rostov-on-Don.

Full description of each concession in the above list, with capital required and approximate production, may be obtained from the Amtorg Trading Corporation, 165 Broadway, New York City.

Table of Contents: The Soviet Union: Facts, Descriptions, Statistics

PATENTS

By decree of the Central Executive Committee of September, [1924], patent laws were established somewhat similar to those in force before the world war. In December, [1924], a Committee on Inventions was created to carry out the provisions of the patent laws and to conduct the business of the Patent Office.

The Soviet patent laws follow the same general lines as those of Germany, and give similar protection to the inventor. The Soviet Union does not belong to the International Patent Convention. It has, however, a special patent agreement with Germany.

Foreigners may obtain patents on equal terms with the citizens of the U.S.S.R. The patent may be also granted to a corporation when it is difficult to determine the work of an individual inventor in an industrial organization. Patents are issued for a term of 15 years and there is no filing fee. Taxes on the invention are paid only after it has been realized or exploited.

The patent gives exclusive right to the inventor to exploit the invention industrially in the U.S.S.R. The patentee may manufacture and sell his invention, he may license other manufacturers, or he may sell or assign his patent. At the expiration of the term of five years after the grant of a patent the inventor must show that he is working his patent in the U.S.S.R., the rules in this respect being similar to those prevailing in other European countries. The inventor may lose his patent if it is proved before the court that he is using his patent only as a means to exclude the invention from general use. If the inventor neglects to work his patent, he may be compelled to grant manufacturing licenses at a royalty fixed by the courts.

During the first three years of the operation of the new patent laws, the following number of patent applications were received by the Committee on Inventions:

[1924]-25   5,451
[1925]-26   8,249
[1926]-27   8,323
Total for three years   22,023
Out of this number 3,938 applicantions were filled by foriegners, distributed among the principle countries as follows:

Germany 2,666
United States   245
England 210
Holland 170
Sweden  137
Austria 109
France  91
Czecho-Slovakia 63
Italy   54
Spain   32
Other Countries 161
Total   3,938
It will be noted that by far the largest number of patent applications was received from German inventors. As the table shows, the total number of German applications was more than ten times the number of applications from the United States.

The distribution of German patent applications in the U.S.S.R. for the three years that the patent laws have been in force was as follows:

[1924]-25   325
[1925]-26   573
[1926]-27   1,768
Total   2,666
Since the work of the Committee on Inventions started practically anew three years ago, it is not surprising that a comparatively small number of patents has been granted to date. Number of patents granted in the past three years:

[1924]-25   690
[1925]-26   1,019
[1926]-27   1,946
Total   3,655
Out of the total number 396 patents have been granted to foreign inventors, or about 11 per cent.

The patent applications cover a wide field of inventions classified into 90 groups. The largest number of patent applications (2,551) is in the class of Electrical and Radio Apparatus. Next follow Instruments and Apparatus (1,256), Chemical Processes and Apparatus (1,101) and Railroad Appliances (849). The next ten groups are shown below:

Internal Combustion Engines and Spring Motors   573
Parts of Machines   522
Agricultural Implements 505
Furnaces and Gas Producers  449
Household Appliances    431
Machines and Tools for Metals   415
Steam Boilers   386
Aviation    371
Wind and Water Motors   347
Firearms and Ammunition 334
The encouragement given by the patent laws and by the Committee on Inventions to individual inventors has resulted in the development of a number of important inventions, which are being exploited in the U.S.S.R. on a considerable scale. The Committee on Inventions publishes a monthly journal containing abstracts of patents and articles and communications pertaining to patent practice in the U.S.S.R.

Trade Marks

Patents for trade marks in the U.S.S.R. may be obtained by foreign manufacturers who are permitted to do business in the territory of the U.S.S.R. or who are nationals of a country permitting the registration of trade marks for citizens of the U.S.S.R. Since the laws of the United States permit the registration of trade marks of applicants from the Soviet Union, a similar privilege is enjoyed reciprocally in the U.S.S.R. by American citizens. The term of registration is fixed by the applicant. The filing fee is 10 rubles, and the registration fee is 5 rubles per year.

During the past three years 1779 trade marks have been registered in U.S.S.R., including 891 of foreign origin.

Copyright Laws

Under the statutes of the U.S.S.R. and the copyright laws and decrees of the Constituent Republics writers are strictly protected in the property rights to their work. Laws and decrees on copyright may be found in the Soviet Union Review, published by the Soviet Union Information Bureau, issue of November, [1928].

In connection with foreign works, the basic decree of [1928] reads: "In the case of works published abroad or existing abroad in the shape of manuscript, sketch or some other concrete form, copyright shall be recognized only if there is a special agreement between the U.S.S.R. and the country concerned, and only within the limits established by such agreement."

COOPERATIVES

THE co-operative organizations of the Soviet Union play a big part in the economic scheme. Their membership was close to 35,000,000 in [1928], their annual turnover had risen to about $11,000,000,000 in [1928]. During [1927]-28 they conducted 55 per cent of the wholesale trade of the country (exclusive of sales of producers direct to jobbers), and 62.4 per cent of the retail trade, as well as about io per cent of the foreign trade. Their share in the internal trade of the country is steadily increasing and their annual turnover has quadrupled in the past three years. The Consumers' Cooperatives alone conducted 85,000 stores. They had a turnover of $7,475,000,000 in [1927]-28.

Membership in the co-operative societies is about triple the membership prior to the Revolution. The increased growth has come during the past five years, for the co-operatives disintegrated during the period of civil wars.

The case of the Consumers' Cooperatives may be taken as typical. In [1913] the membership was less than 2,000,000. During the World War, with the breakdown of the normal processes of distribution and the steady collapse of administrative organs of the Government, the co-operatives gained importance rapidly as organs of distribution and their membership increased to 7,000,000 by [1917]. After the Soviet Government assumed power, in the period when invasions and civil wars disrupted all economic processes, the Government was compelled to commandeer the machinery of the Consumers' Cooperatives for distributive purposes. Under this exigent regimen the voluntary membership fell off greatly. After it became possible to restore the autonomy of the Consumers' Cooperatives the membership began a rapid recovery. In [1926]-27 it was over 15,000,000, 39 per cent in the cities, Or per cent in the villages. On October 1, [1928], it was 22,581,000. The membership represents 28 per cent of all peasant farms and 60 per cent of all city workers and office employees.

The Consumers' Cooperatives now sell to the public over 60 per cent of the cotton fabrics, 53 per cent of the kerosene, 73 per cent of the salt, 65 per cent of the sugar, 45 per cent of shoes and leather articles. Their share in purchases from the peasants includes 28 per cent in grain, 16 per cent in eggs, 20 per cent in flax.

During the period of civil wars and intervention, agricultural cooperation virtually ceased. The revival did not begin on a large scale until after the stabilization of the currency in [1924]. In January, [1924], the agricultural co-operatives had 1,200,000 members. In October, [1927], they had nearly 7,700,000 members. On that date the membership represented 30 per cent of all peasant farms.

Purchases of the Agricultural Cooperatives in various commodities, run to the following percentages of the total marketed products: grain 16 per cent, butter 60 per cent, flax 35 per cent, tobacco r per cent, cotton 90 per cent, sugar beets 45 per cent. They furnish agricultural raw materials for industries. They are a major factor in supplying machinery and implements to farmers. They furnish loans in the form of both money and seed. They conduct stations for renting agricultural machinery and for seed-cleaning and testing. They maintain a widely distributed staff of 2,000 agricultural specialists to give assistance and advice to farmers.

The Handicraft Cooperatives unite the home craftsmen of the towns and villages, enabling them to secure better marketing conditions and to provide them with materials.

The Housing Cooperatives have taken on increasing importance from the rise of industrialization and the steady drift of population to the cities. Their function is the collective building and management of dwellings.

The number of cooperatives of the various types and their membership, as of [1926]-27, is shown in the following table:

LABOR

AT the close of [1927] the output of Soviet industries was estimated at 10 per cent above pre-war, while the labor force was about equal to that of [1913]. The gain in labor efficiency is the more marked when one considers that the length of the average working day has been reduced by about 25 per cent as compared with [1913].

Real wages for workers in industry in [1926]-27 were about 1 per cent above those of [1913]. This does not take account of the various additional benefits and services received gratis by the workers. As a charge upon the industries these benefits and services make an addition amounting to 32 per cent of the total payroll.

The highest expenditures of this character are reported by the oil industry, which pays out 6 per cent of the amount of the payroll for additional benefits for the workers.

Money wages have risen steadily for the past few years. In the large-scale industries they increased 17 per cent in [1927]. Wages of office workers are generally higher than those of industrial workers. Wages in Moscow are about 35 per cent higher than in other cities.

The labor efficiency has risen through better industrial processes and better machinery. Output per worker in the Soviet Union is still low by Western European standards, but it has been showing a healthy rate of advance. The advance has been aided by a campaign against absenteeism. In [1913] the days of actual work per worker in industry were 257. In the fiscal year [1921]-22 they had fallen to 219.5. In [1926]-27 they were 262.1.

On the other hand the length of the normal working day, which was 10 hours before the war, was reduced to 8 hours at the beginning of the Soviet régime, and for dangerous occupations to 6 hours. During [1926]-27 the working day averaged 7.5 hours.

The Council of People's Commissars, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Soviet State, in November, [1927], decreed the gradual introduction of the 7-hour day in industry. This is being put in force first in the textile industry.

Labor conditions are regulated by the Code of Labor Laws and by collective agreements between employers and the trade unions. Workers are hired generally through Government labor exchanges and the trade unions. Labor disputes are referred to Arbitration Committees, on which both the management and the labor union are represented. Since wages follow productive efficiency, the worker feels that he has a stake in the increasing efficiency of the industrial process. This feeling is a natural corollary of his proprietary position in respect to the industry and the country generally.

Under the labor laws no children under 14 years may be employed in industry. Between the ages of 14 and 16 a 4-hour day is permitted, and between the ages of 16 and 18 a 6-hour day. All industries are required to employ and train a specified quota of apprentices.

During the year there are fourteen legal holidays for workers. In addition each worker has a two weeks' vacation with pay, and in dangerous or heavy vocations an additional two weeks is allowed. In 146 of the dangerous trades a shorter working day is in effect.

Women workers receive from six to eight weeks' vacation with pay before and after childbirth.

The special benefits and services provided by employers under the law include free or nominal rentals for housing, free fuel, water, electric light, transportation, special working clothing, dental and medical service, social insurance (see section on Insurance).

Safety and health regulations are strictly enforced by labor inspectors with the result that much progress has been made in reducing the number of accidents and occupational diseases.

The right to strike is maintained in respect to State enterprises as well as private factories. Under the arbitral provisions of the Labor Code strikes have been reduced to a minimum during the past few years.

TRADE UNIONS.- Trade unions play a most important role in both the social and economic scheme of the Soviet Union. Membership is entirely voluntary. Trade union officers are elected directly by the members and are directly responsible to them.

There are twenty-three large central trade unions in the U.S.S.R. These are united in the Central Council of Trade Unions.

The trade unions, through their factory committees, have organized special production committees in State factories and enterprises. There are over 50,000 of these production committees. Collaborating with engineers and specialists in the industries, the committees have a splendid record of accomplishment in increasing the output of the individual worker, facilitating inventions and bringing about better organization of work and higher rationalization of industry.

The cultural-educational work of the trade unions has brought equally impressive results and has been a mighty factor in the work of stamping out illiteracy. This work is an organic part of every department of the labor organization. The educational program includes the formation of clubs, libraries, schools, discussion circles of all kinds, the production of newspapers and other literature. The trade unions now maintain about 4,000 clubs and nearly 10,000 libraries.

The growth of trade union membership is shown in the following table:

Oct. [1925] Oct. [1926] July 1, [1927]
Industry    2,787,600   3,319,700   3,566,100

Total   7,846,800   9,541,200   10,710,251,60
Membership of trade unions as of October 1, [1928], was 11,034,600.

UNEMPLOYMENT.- Despite the steady rise of industry and the attendant increases in the labor force, unemployment remains at a high figure because of the rapid increase of population and the constant influx of young peasants to the industrial centers. Of the 1,352,800 registered unemployed at the beginning of [1928], 263,900, or nearly 20 per cent, were men seeking jobs in industry who had never before been employed in industrial work. There is little unemployment among skilled workers.

Unemployment figures vary with the seasons. It reaches its peak in the winter and early spring and declines by 300,000,000 to 500,000 during the summer months, when irrigation and reclamation work gives much temporary employment and many of the jobless ones of the city can be absorbed in the agricultural field.

Number of unemployed in the U.S.S.R. as of January 1:

[1924]  1,240,000
[1925]  980,000
[1926]  988,000
[1927]  7,350,000
[1928]  1,352,000
The expenditures for unemployment (pensions, etc.) during the past four years were as follows:

Federal and Local Budgets Rubles    Social Insurance Fund Rubles    Trade Unions Rubles Total Rubies
[1923]-24   4,350,000   18,000,000  4,000,000   26,350,000
[1924]-25   14,000,000  30,000,000  7,500,000   51,500,000

Total   58,550,000  160,000,000 31,500,000  253,050,000
This does not include the earnings of the collectives of unemployed which have been organized to render various services.

SOCIAL INSURANCE.- Social insurance, conducted by the State, and under the direct control of the workers' organizations, includes insurance against disability and unemployment, for women during and after pregnancy, and covers mortuary payments to helpless dependents. This insurance is a charge against the employing industry, whether State, cooperative or private. Every employer must contribute 4.5 per cent of the amount of his payroll to the insurance fund.

INSURANCE

THE State Insurance Administration was organized in January, [1922]. The Insurance Administration writes policies covering fire, life, transportation, hail, livestock, mortality, etc. There has been a particular development of insurance designed to insure the stability of rural economic enterprises. Obligatory insurance in some categories has been established to this end and its scope has been gradually extended.

The growth of rural insurance is shown by the following properties covered by State Insurance policies:

[1922]-23   [1927]-28
Fire (peasant farms)    17,000,000  20,000,000
Cattle (head)   11,000,000  40,400,000
Horses (head)   200,000 18,800,000
Hail (acres)    113,400,000 212,500,000
In [1923]-24 the liabilities of the State Insurance Administration, under the head of obligatory rural insurance, were $1,300,000,000. In [1927]-28 they had reached $3,664,000,000.

By [1926]-27 the number of urban properties covered by obligatory insurance reached 1,330,000.

Voluntary fire insurance, which serves chiefly the needs of trade and industry, by the beginning of [1928] covered 65 per cent of the actual capital of industry, about o per cent of the estimated value of goods in all classes of industry, and about 63 per cent of all housing.

Life insurance was started in [1924]. In [1924]-25 the amount paid out in premiums was $432,000, in [1926]-27 it was $1,390,000.

Amounts paid by the State Insurance Administration for all branches of insurance:

[1922]-23   $10,094,000
[1923]-24   34,041,500
[1924]25    49,285,500

NEWSPAPERS AND BOOKS

NEWSPAPER circulation in the Soviet Union has grown with the growth of literacy. Before the war the combined circulation of the newspapers was 2,500,000 and in the spring of [1928] it was 8,250,000. There were fewer newspapers in [1928] than in [1913], but individual circulations were much larger. Magazines, which had but a slight circulation before the Revolution, now have a circulation even greater than the newspapers.

Newspapers  Total Circulation
[1913]  859 2,500,700
[1923]  485 3,013,139
[1924]  53! 4,447,603

[1928] (April 1)    559 8,250,200
Magazines   Circulation
[1927]  1,291   8,403,540
Of the newspaper circulation in [1928] over 5,000,000 represented daily newspapers. Of this about one-fifth was represented by the circulation of the two principal dailies, Izvestia and Pravda, both published in Moscow. In August, [1928], the daily circulation of Izvestia averaged 432,325 copies and of Pravda 572,183 copies.

The distribution of the newspapers among the six Constituent Republics in [1927] was as follows:

Newspapers  Total Circulation
R.S.F.S.R   395 6,318,000
Ukraine 89  878,000
Transcaucasia   34  278,000
White Russia    19  102,000
Uzbek and Turkoman  19  108,000
Total       7,684,000
At the present time newspapers, magazines and books are being published in 49 languages, in 27 of which there was no publication prior to the war. There were 206 newspapers with a circulation of 831,753 published in non-Russian languages in [1927], as well as 130 magazines. The non-Russian nationalities had 34 book publishing houses. Between [1919] and [1925] a total of 5,430 books were published in the Ukrainian language, more than had been published in the previous 120 years.

Before the war there were only four peasant papers with a negligible circulation. To-day there are over 200 with a total circulation of nearly 2,000,000. Of these 9 with a circulation of 435,670 are printed in languages other than Russian. On the average one farm out of ten subscribes to a newspaper.

The worker and peasant newspaper correspondents constitute an enormous army. There were 192,889 peasant correspondents in [1927], and 115,607 worker correspondents, a total of 335,448, as compared with 216,000 in [1925].

The peasant periodicals have done much, by a ceaseless warfare against inefficiency in village Soviets, to improve the character of local administrations. Chief among these periodicals is the weekly Peasant Gazette (Krestyanskaya Gazeta) with a circulation of well over a million, with upwards of 6,000 village correspondents. This paper receives close to a million letters annually from peasant subscribers.

BOOKS.- There are some 2,000 organizations in the Soviet Union engaged in the publication of books, but these include not more than 100 with any considerable output, and of these 30 central publishing houses produce 80 per cent of the entire output of books. Of these the State Publishing House (Gosizdat) of the R.S.F.S.R. is by far the most important, publishing half the number of copies issued in the Soviet Union and furnishing half the total book trade turnover. Private publishing houses in [1927] furnished less than 25 per cent of the total number of titles and only 6 per cent of the number of copies. They are declining both in number and output.

The total book production amounts to from $50,000,000 to $60,000,000 annually, at cost price.

The State Publishing House originated in [1919] as a departmental publishing office of the People's Commissariat of Education. With the inauguration of the new economic policy it was placed on an independent and nominally profit-making basis. It issues from 3,250 to 3,750 titles annually.

Statistics of book publishing in U.S.S.R.:

Titles  Copies
[1912]  34,620  133,562,000
[1925]   36,416 242,036,000
[1927]   44,000 190,000,000
Titles of books published in [1926] were divided under the following categories:

Textbooks   40
Sociology and Economics 6
Lenin Literature    5
Propaganda (1)  20
Peasant Literature  16
Science 5
Popular Science 2
Children's Literature   2
Belles Lettres and Art  4
Total   100
(1) The term "propaganda," as used in the Soviet Union, has a much broader connotation than that commonly applied in the United States. The hooks so listed include the huge literature on such diverse subjects of popular instruction as personal hygiene, cam of children, home economics, diet, temperance, exercise, mental improvement, personal efficiency, etc.

PUBLIC HEALTH

The death rate for the U.S.S.R. in [1926] was 20.9 per thousand, as compared with 28.3 in [1913], a decrease of 26.2 per cent. In the 25 years before the war the national death rate decreased only 4 per 1,000.

The death rate for infants was 27 per cent in [1913]. In [1927] it had fallen to 18 per cent. In [1926] the total number of infant deaths in the U.S.S.R. was 600,000 less than in [1913].

The general death rate in Moscow in [1913] was 23.1 per thousand. In [1926] it was 13.4. The infant mortality rate was 26 per cent in [1913] and in [1926] it was 13.5 per cent.

The birth rate in [1926] for the entire country was 44.0 per thousand. In [1913] it was 45.5 per thousand. The annual increase in population per thousand in [1926] was 23.1. For [1911]-13 inclusive it averaged 16.1.

According to measurements of 40,000 school children in Moscow, the average height of children of the same age in [1926] was greater by from 4 to 9.5 centimeters than before the war.

In the Soviet Union public health is the special charge of the Commissariat for Health in each of the six Constituent Republics. The Commissariats are organized on the principle that the health of the people is the business of the State. In application there has been organized a close observation of health conditions and of individuals. Special protection has been organized for women in the period of childbirth, for infants, for workers in dangerous occupations. Minors under '4 may not be employed in industry.

Sanatoriums, hospitals, dispensaries and health resorts have been steadily multiplied. In R.S.F.S.R. alone in [1927] the health resorts had accommodations for 24,460 persons, and the number of sanatoriums had increased from 300 to 1,607 in four years.

The budgetary appropriations for the protection of maternity and of infants had increased to $22,000,000 in [1927]. This was exclusive of social insurance for women at the time of childbirth. Payments in maternity cases under the social insurance scheme in [1927] reached $50,000,000. The number of establishments for maternity cases was 3,250, not including summer créches. The number of summer day nurseries was over 6,000 in [1928], having increased each year for ten years.

The aid of the masses of the population has been successfully enlisted in carrying out general measures of health protection.

Physical culture, encouraged by health and educational authorities, has made great strides. The trade unions have greatly assisted in this development. At the beginning of [1927] the membership in physical culture organizations was over 4,000,000.

Stadiums and gymnastic halls have been built during the past three years in most of the principal Russian cities. The workers' clubs operate well-equipped gymnasiums. The central home of physical culture, opened in Leningrad in the fall of [1927], has a great hail for gymnastics, and a huge swimming pool for the equipment of which the trade unions of Leningrad expended $100,000.

EDUCATION

The administration of education in the Soviet Union is under the direction of a People's Commissariat for Education in each of the six Constituent Republics. There is no federal Commissariat for Education. Each Republican Commissariat for Education enjoys complete autonomy in its own territory. However, as a result of cooperative effort and inter-Republican conferences, educational programs and policies are conspicuously in harmony.

In each Constituent Republic the functions of the Commissariat for Education include control over scientific organizations, museums and historical monuments, musical and art institutes, the theater and the cinema and the State publishing enterprises. All such institutions are utilized as a part of the general educational scheme.

In addition to formal educational work directed by the Commissariats, important activities are carried on by various voluntary organizations. These include various Youth Associations, the Red Army, the Trade Unions and the Cooperatives. Moreover millions of people take an active part in educational work through such societies as "Down with Illiteracy," "Friends of the Children" and many others.

The Revolution released among the masses of the population an active craving for educational advancement. The economic rehabilitation has afforded the means for a steady expansion of the educational program.

In the curricula of the schools the most modern methods are applied in accord with local needs.

Public education is a charge against the six Constituent Republics and against the localities concerned. Local appropriations are in the aggregate about double those of the Republican Governments. Expenditures for the past few years, in millions of dollars:

[1924]-25    [1925]-26   [1926]-27
Budgets of Constituent Republics     62.9    84.6    105.3
Local Budgets   118.4    151.8  211.9
Total   181.3    236.4  317.2
Appropriations for [1927]-28 were upwards of $400,000,000.

In the fall of [1928], 11,372,507 children were in Soviet schools (excluding kindergartens), 46 per cent more than at the time of the outbreak of the World War. There were 118,184 schools as compared with 106,400 in [1913]. The teaching staff numbered 337,435. Out of each 100 children of school age 70 were in school. The percentage in the cities was 98.4 and in the villages 66.3, with the percentage steadily rising, especially in the rural districts.

In the teaching in various schools throughout the country a total of seventy national tongues are used. Out of every X,00o pupils 624 are taught in the Russian language, 75 in Ukrainian, 36 in White Russian, 27 in Tartar, 19 in Georgian, 14 in Armenian, io in Azerbaijan-Turkish, 9 in Uzbek, the rest scattered.

The steady rise in educational facilities since the famine years is shown in the following table:

Elementary Education    Secondary Education

[1926]-27   108,424 9,903,439   1,708   784,871
Before the war there were virtually no kindergartens in Russia. Pre-school education is now being rapidly developed. Its expansion has been somewhat held back by the fact that the struggle against illiteracy has absorbed so much of the funds and energies of the educational authorities. Figures for pre-school education:

Schools Pupils
[1925]  1,139   60,196
[1926]   1,364  72,406
[1927]  1,629   85,349
During the summer of [1927] there were 4,000 playgrounds attended by 200,000 children in R.S.KS.R. (Soviet Russia proper) alone.

Institutes for higher education have expanded in the same degree as the elementary schools. At the universities and technical institutes more than a third of the students are women. Some of the statistics of higher education follow:

Higher Trade Schools
[1924]-25   [1925]-26   [1926]-27

The figures given above do not exhaust the catalogue of educational institutions. The "Rabfacs," or high schools for workers, had 45,702 students in [1926]-27. The growth of other establishments is illustrated in the following table:

[1924]-25   [1925]-26   [1926]-27

    Urban   734 703 733
    Rural   107 89  113
The warfare against adult illiteracy, conducted by many voluntary organizations as well as by the Government, has resulted in the creation of tens of thousands of schools for adult education. The figures:

[1924]-25   [1925]-24   [1926]-27
Schools for illiterates and semi-literates  42,004  49,804  54,600
Pupils   2,150,000  1,600,000   1,317,000
With the spread of literacy among those able and willing to learn, the number of pupils has already begun to decline.

BEZPRIZORNI, (HOMELESS CHILDREN).- As a result of the World War, the civil struggles, the famine and particularly the widespread massacres by the military adventurers who raided the newly-formed Soviet State with armies financed from abroad, hundreds of thousands of small children were left as orphans to sustain themselves as best they could. During the early days of the new State the lack of resources did not afford an adequate opportunity to cope with the problem of these waifs, scattered over a broad territory. Their surviving neighbors or relatives likewise lacked the resources to care for them. The bezprizorn1, hardened by a desperate struggle to live, grew up as wild things. They roamed the country and prowled in the cities in predatory bands. They presented a serious social problem.

In [1922] it was estimated that there were a million of these "wild children" at large. As the country began to move towards an economic recovery, every effort was made to wean the children from lawlessness and transform them into useful citizens. The Government has expended millions of dollars on this work, and voluntary organizations, including millions of citizens, have devoted time and energy to it. Special colonies and schools for the bezprizorni sprang up everywhere and the foremost educational talent in the country has devoted itself to the problem. It has been tackled in a sympathetically scientific rather than a disciplinary or punitive manner.

To-day there are 200 colonies, each accommodating from 60 to 3,000 of the children in the Ukraine alone. By the spring of [1928] the authorities estimated that not more than 25,000 of the bezprizorni still persisted in their wild life, and the number was being steadily reduced.

LITERACY.- The western portions of the former Russian Empire, which were lost at the close of the World War, had the highest degree of culture in a country where education among the masses had been persistently frowned upon by the authorities. The excision of these lands left all the more urgent the problem of illiteracy confronting the Soviet State. Under the census of 1897, the last general census before the World War, 37.9 per cent of the male population above seven years were literate and 12.5 per cent of the female population. During the next fifteen years literacy made no great strides among the population. The general census of December, [1926], however, revealed that the energetic struggle against illiteracy conducted by the Soviet State was bearing fruit. For the first time in Russian history the majority of the population could read and write. The percentages of literacy were 65.4 for males and 36.7 for females (above the age of seven years). The literate population of the Soviet Union was: males, 35,940,975; females, 22,038,261.

The territories with the highest percentage of literacy are the Ukraine, the European part of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic and White Russia.

Percentage of Literacy
Ukraine European Part of R.S.F.S.R. White Russia
Men 74.4    72.5    70.3
Women   40.6    41.3    35.4
The lowest percentage of literacy is presented by the Central Asiatic republics, as shown by the following figures:

Turkoman Republic   Uzbek Republic
Men 16.2    13
Women   7.6 57
If the percentage of literacy as established in [1926] is set at 100, then the literacy prevailing at the time when the preceding censuses were taken may be expressed by the following figures for the European part of the U.S.S.R.:

1897    [1920]
Men 58  77
Women   34  75
Interesting data are obtained by a comparison of the census data for 1897, [1920] and [1926] regarding the percentage of the literacy according to the various age classes. The highest percentage of literacy is shown by the following age classes:

1897    [1920]  [1926]
Men from 12 to 15 yrs.  from 25 to 29 yrs.  from 20 to 24 yrs.
Women    from 12 to 15 yrs. from 12 to 15 yrs.  from 20 to 24 yrs.
Thus, according to the census of [1926] the highest degree of literacy is shown by the age classes of from 20 to 24 years of both sexes, while in 1897 the highest degree of literacy for both sexes was presented by the age classes from 12 to 15 years.

It is only in the old age classes that divergency between the percentage of literacy among men and women can be noticed. At the lower age classes the percentage figures for men and women for [1926] were much closer to each other than during the censuses of the previous years. Moreover, during the period between [1920] and [1926] the relation between the literacy of men and women has changed considerably in favor of women of the age class of from 20 to 29 years.

As regards the literacy of the urban and rural populations, a considerable discrepancy is still to be noted in favor of the urban population, while in the age classes with the highest literacy - (24-25 years for men and 19 years for women) - the literacy of men amounts to 95.7 per cent and that of women to 88.2 per cent; the corresponding figures in the rural localities amount to 85.4 and 55.6 respectively.

The table below gives the literacy figures for the entire population of the U.S.S.R. (of 8 years of age and over) and of its constituent parts, for men and women, under the census of December, [1926]:

THE ARTS

IN literature, music, painting, sculpture, architecture and the theater the new Soviet society may be said to he still in a transition stage. During the first years in the arts generally there was a natural tendency to extreme experimentalism. This has been succeeded by a steadying process, a settling down to a creative interpretation of the new life. In all the arts there is a healthy clash of diverse schools and tendencies. The experimental vigor has given rise to many novel forms which have attracted attention in other countries. The mechanics of the stage have had a particularly interesting development. In motion pictures the dramatic realism of a number of Soviet productions has won acclaim throughout Europe and America. In architecture there is a new realistic note and the new buildings are distinctly modernistic and western, in contrast to the rococo imitations and the flaring orientalism of Tsarist times. In sculpture the aspiration is towards monumentalism and industrial application. Painting, music and literature have been steadily orienting themselves to the new conditions of life and already have attained to considerable solid achievement.

In all the arts visiting observers note that the creative forces are vigorously alive, and questions of theory and practice are treated with unusual breadth of vision. This is probably implicit in a society where the masses of the population take a vital interest in the work of the artist.

THE THEATER.- The revolution has resulted in a great transformation in the Russian theater.

During the last years of the old régime, growing restrictions on free expression gradually divorced the theater from the realities of life. Symbolism became a refuge of safety. The ballet flourished and drew from oriental themes a gorgeous color and exoticism.

The Revolution flung the theater open to the masses, and the new audiences, steeled by the civil wars, were indifferent to symbolism and to mild introspection, and demanded themes representative of the new life.

The theater responded to the demands to a remarkable degree. For a time there was a special emphasis on the mechanics of representation and this sometimes took the form of eccentricity not unnatural in a time of general transvaluation of values. New dramas of the struggle of the man with the machine lent themselves to the passion for startling mechanical effects, and even the classics were re-treated to accord with the new mode. Extravagant tendencies were eventually curbed by the seriousness of the new mass-audiences. Their taste was for dramas giving a coherent picture of the new Soviet society, and their taste has prevailed. Stanislavsky's Art Theater, which at first continued to play Chekhov and Maeterlinck in the old manner, eventually responded to the new spirit and applied its naturalism to the production of Ivanov's "Armored Train." At the other end of the scale the more advanced mechanistic producers gradually relegated startling mechanical effects to their proper place and gave primary emphasis to the play itself and the spoken word.

Of the outstanding producers, Meyerhold stands at the opposite pole from Stanislavsky's naturalism. In the past ten years Meyerhold has not hesitated to reshape the content of plays and to attempt every conceivable experiment in staging and acting. In his production dependence rests upon the scenic artist and the director rather than on the playwright. Tairov, in the Kamerny Theater, has sought a modus vivendi between the methods of Stanislavsky and of Meyerhold.

There are 500 theaters in the Soviet Union with an annual attendance of 15,000,000.

In addition to the formal theaters, a spontaneous amateur theater movement of imposing proportions has grown up in the Soviet Union. Such performances take place in factory, town and village clubs, in which the workers write, produce and act plays portraying their life in the Soviet society. The most important of these theaters is the M.G.S.P.S., conducted by Moscow trade unions, in which plays like "The Humming of the Rails" and "Storm" have brought the factory and the machine on the stage in strikingly realistic form. There are some 35,000 of these club theaters in the cities and towns and 30,000 in the villages. Contemporary life is also reflected in the performances of the troupes of "Blue Blouses" of which there are about 10,000. They travel about the country to perform before local trade unions and peasant clubs and their repertoire includes songs, acrobatics, dancing and satirical sketches. An interesting theatrical movement of broad proportions has also sprung up in clubs attached to the Red Army.

There is an excellent group of theaters in Leningrad, while Baku, Tiflis, and other capitals of the minor nationalities have their own theaters playing in the native languages.

MOTION PICTURES.- The motion picture has assumed an unusual vitality in the Soviet Union. While the technical resources of the Soviet studios are still markedly below Hollywood standards, skilled direction has achieved a degree of artistry comparable to that of pictures produced anywhere. The motion picture lends itself admirably as a medium for depicting the mass dramas of the Revolutionary years, and the result has been pictures such as "The End of St. Petersburg" and "October," which has been shown with success abroad as well as at home, and the pre-Revolutionary picture "The Cruiser Potemkin." The screen also is well adapted to the portrayal of the drama of reconstruction in the Soviet Union, the new conquest of the machine, the rise of factories and power plants, the bringing of education to the villages, the emancipation of women among backward national units, etc. A wealth of material has also been found in Russian history. In employing this diverse material, directors such as Eisenstein, Pudovkin, etc., have achieved commendable results.

In the spring of [1928] there were 8,767 motion picture display places in the Soviet Union. Of these there were 1,500 commercial theaters, 2,767 club theaters, 1,184 rural theaters, 2,496 ambulant displays and 420 miscellaneous. The cities and towns had 57 per cent of these places of entertainment and the rural districts 43 per cent.

Of the 1,800 theaters charging admission, 40 per cent were operated by trade unions, 35 per cent by the Department of Education, 3 per cent by Sovkino (the principal producing organization) and i per cent by private persons.

Of the total number of display places 6,459 were in R.S.F.S.R. (Soviet Russia proper). Of these the commercial, club and rural theaters had a total attendance of over 260,000,000 in [1927]28.

LITERATURE.- To the western world modern Russian literature is chiefly known through translations of Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Turgeniev, Chekhov, Gorky, and Andreyev. These classics are still published in the Soviet Union. In connection with the centenary of Tolstoy's birth the State Publishing House (Gosizdat) issued the great novelist's collected works in Too volumes.

The writers of the new Russia naturally could not merely resume where their classical predecessors left off. The October Revolution destroyed old values and created new ones. In the early days of the civil war the young Russian writers had to face the problem of reflecting in literature the profound social changes which had taken place. A reaction set in against passive naturalism, and the new literature sought to speak directly to the masses of the Russian people, to proclaim their aspirations in vigorous imaginative terms, and to stir them on to reorganize social consciousness. A striking example of this attempt of literature to participate actively in the march of the new order is shown in the works of Demyan Bednyi. The songs, poems, and agitational rhymes and satires of this talented political poet were directed to the wide masses of the people.

Another poet who shaped the themes, form and language of his verse to the mold of the Revolution, is Vladimir Mayakovsky, the leader of the Futurist school in the Soviet Union. Mayakovsky, however, is much more sophisticated than Demyan Bednyi. Raised in Russia's literary Bohemia, Mayakovsky brought to the Revolution the technical experiments of futurism, as contrasted with Demyan Bednyi's simple ballads based on old folk forms. Mayakovsky's "Left March," "Manifesto," "150,000,000 ," "Lenin" and "Mysteria Bouffe" express the new era in strong, fresh rhythms, works and images.

The most eminent poet of the pre-revolutionary intelligentsia who tried to understand the Revolution was Alexander Blok. In his gifted poem "The Twelve" he treats the Revolution as a mystical phenomenon, a cyclonic collapse of culture, a rebellious transvaluation of those values which had been sanctified by religion. He envisions the transvaluation as experienced by a profoundly suffering humanity. Blok approached the Revolution as an intellectual whose imagination worked with religious images; and in that sense is generally considered to have failed in grasping the full import of the new era.

A poet completely different from any of the foregoing is Serge Yessenin, whose premature death several years ago deprived Russian literature of perhaps its most gifted lyricist. Yessenin's poetry had its roots in the village, though it also showed the influence of the literary Bohemia in which he moved during the last years of his life. He was the best product of the Imagist school, which for a time had considerable vogue in early Revolutionary Russia. Though it used different technical means, this school resembled Futurism in its Bohemian tendencies, and its attempts to shock the reader by the novelty, surprise, rudeness and even vulgarity of its images. The Imagists, however, did not break with old esthetic traditions, as did the Futurists, who demolished the old sthetics altogether and to that extent were revolutionaries in art. Because of their preoccupation with the image, which they considered the basic element of poetry, leading poets of the Imagist school, like Marienhof, Kusikov, Grusinov, and Shershenyevitch, neglected revolutionary themes. These poets enjoyed a brief fragile glory in the early days of the Revolution. Had Yessenin been merely an Imagist he would have passed away with them. But he was more than that. Apart from his superb lyric gifts, he expressed the psychology of the backward peasant. In long poems like "Pugachev," "Inonia," "Pantocrator," he describes the revolt of the peasants sweeping away city culture including the church and preparing the way for a peasant paradise.

The storm and stress period of the Revolution was naturally favorable for verse and unfavorable for prose. Short poems were the only possible vehicles for the only people who were in a position to write, and who were still influenced by the old culture of the nobility, the bourgeoisie and the city intellectuals; it was the inevitable medium for the individualistic romanticism of transition writers. The end of the civil war brought sufficient leisure for sustained prose, and the Soviet Union produced a number of novels which were in effect memoirs of the civil war.

Among the best of these is Furmanov's "Chapayev," describing a revolutionary workingman, and "The Revolt," dealing with the civil war. In these chronicles the method is naturalistic, depending on documents and facts which speak for themselves. Both these books breathe a spirit of grandeur, but their power is derived almost wholly from the facts they present.

The civil war is treated romantically in Lehedinsky's "A Week," which has been translated into English. A similar method is employed by Serafimovitch in "The Iron Stream." The romanticism of these writers is far from the European type associated with mysticism and pacifism. These authors portray the heroism of a great historical era and implicitly celebrate the will to act, the collective effect of the masses overcoming enormous difficulties. Both Seraflmovitch and Lehedinsky are Communists and are counted among the socalled "proletarian writers." One of the pre-revolutionary novelists who describe the civil war from the liberal intellectual's point of view is Veresayev whose "Deadlock" has been translated into English.

The peace following the civil war encouraged the development of the so-called "FellowTravelers," writers of various types and talents who were not themselves of the new order, but who accepted the Revolution, and were willing to "travel" along with it. They came from the peasantry, the intellectuals and the urban middle-classes. These writers lacked the active spirit of the Revolution animating the works of Demyan Bedny1, Mayakovsky, Serafimovitch, and Lebedinsky. They retained a good deal of pre-revolutionary passivism, being content to portray events as they saw them, without seeking to extract their full social implications. Their works show great technical mastery. The "Fellow-Travelers" also wrote their first books around the civil war from which they had just emerged. Among the best of their novels are Vsevolod Ivanov's "Armored Train" and "Colored Winds"; Yakovlev's "October"; Babel's "Red Cavalry" and "Tales"; Seifullina's "Virineya" and "Dung"; Artyom Vesyolyi's "The Homeland"; Malishkin's "The Fall of Dair"; Leonid Leonov's "Badgers," and Boris Pilnyak's "Leather Jackets" and "The Naked Year."

The last of these works appeared at a psychological moment. It was the first novel which set itself the task of reflecting Russia's social life in the throes of the civil war.

Among the intellectuals of the old régime who personally accepted the new, but whose works could only skim the surface of Revolutionary Russia, is Alexey Tolstoy. His "Alita," "Engineer Garin's Hyperbole" and "Azure Cities" are wellplanned, plastic and entertaining. A writer of a similar caliber is Fedin, whose "Towns and Years," deal with the civil war, and "Transvaal" with the village under NEP (the new economic policy, after [1921]).

Sooner or later Soviet literature was bound to turn from the civil war to the reconstruction period. The best known novel reflecting this transition is Feeder Gladkov's "Cement." The romanticism which marked the proletarian literature of the first period still clings to this book; but this time the problems of the new society are correctly approached and lines are projected pointing to socialist construction. A number of realistic works dealing with the period of peaceful economic growth followed, notably Lyashko's "The Blast Furnace," and Lidin's "The Ships Are Coming."

Soviet writers also began to portray the new types of people evolved by the new society. Excellent portraits are presented in Lebedinsky's "To-morrow" and "The Commissars"; Tarassov-Rodionov's "Chocolate." Lyashko's novel "The Break" presents the psychology of the Communist worker; while Seifullina's "Virineya" and Gladkov's "Cement" portray types of Soviet women. A number of well-written novels deal with the Soviet youth, notably Malashkin's "The Right Side of the Moon," Panteleimon Romanov's "Without Flowers," and Ognyev's "Diary of a Communist Schoolboy," which has been translated into English.

The peasantry, also, has its place in the new Russian literature. One of the best writers on village life was Neverov, whose "City of Bread," dealing with the famine period in Tashkent, has been translated into English. Fedin's "Transvaal" in a bizarre manner describes the well-to-do peasantry. The transition of the village from the old to the new life is sketched in Karavayev's "The Bears," and "The ChestnutColored Skin," and in Akulshin's "Unbound Sheaves" and "Village Whispers." A strange spectacle of village life is presented by Klichkov in "The Sweet German" and other works, which are poems in prose rather than novels. Vsevolod Ivanov in "The Secret of Secrets" has also essayed to portray the present life of the Russian peasant.

In addition to these and numerous other books describing Russian life since [1917], there have appeared a number of imaginative works revaluating the past in the light of contemporary ideas. Thus the seventeenth century peasant revolt is the theme of Chapigin's "Stenka Razin"; the 1825 revolt is portrayed in Marich's "The Northern Lights" and in Tynyanov's "Kyukhla"; the Revolution of [1905] in Yevdoki mov's "Bells"; pre-Revolutionary Moscow in Andrel Byelyi's "The Moscow Crank," and "Moscow Under the Blow"; the period of October [1917], in Artyom Vesyolyi's "Russia Bathed in Blood" and other works. The historical novel is rapidly becoming one of the most favored forms of literature in Soviet Russia.

The stabilization of Soviet economy in the past few years has matured the new writers considerably. Even their approach to civil war themes reveals a different perspective. Thus Fadeyev's "The Smashup," which relates the story of a group of "partisan" peasants (guerrilla fighters) in Siberia during the civil war, is free of naturalism and romanticism. The novel is ripe and realistic and the images correspond to the contents.

Of late the futurist poet Mayakovsky has been experimenting with long epics as in "Lenin," and in personal lyrics like "It." Others have also attempted epics, notably Bagritsky in the "Thoughts About Opanas," and Selvinsky in his constructivist poem "Ulyalyayevshchina." Pasternak, a lyric poet whose "Sister Is My Life" made him famous, has published a long psychological poem entitled "Spektorsky" and a historical poem "Lieutenant Schmidt."

The best known of the younger poets are Bezymensky, Utkin, Zharov and Svetlov. The futurist group, headed by Mayakovsky and Brick, has produced several talented poets, including Aseyev and Kirsanov; while the lyrical school of which Yessenin was the best representative has found adherents in Oreshin and Nasetkin.

The following works of fiction and poetry by contemporary Russian writers have been translated into English and are available in the United States:

Music.- Though one of Russia's youngest arts, music is among those most highly developed. It originally grew out of the demands of the old aristocracy in the seventeenth century, seeking to imitate the aristocratic culture of western Europe. It was natural, therefore, that the first branch of music to reach excellence in Russia should be the opera, closely related as it was to the imperial court. Musicians of the Neapolitan school, such as Arraya, Galupp1, Cimarosa, and Paisiello, serving at the Tsar's court, produced Russia's first operas. These were followed by French importations. It was only toward the end of the eighteenth and at the beginning of the nineteenth centuries, when the nationalist sentiments fanned in Europe by the French Revolution found an echo in Russia, that native composers began to transform the material of Russian folk song into operas. The greatest of these early Russian composers was Mikhail Glinka, whose works were composed for the court, the nobility, and the new merchant class.

These early composers found themselves burdened by the atmosphere of feudal disintegration of the court and the nobility. They were creating over the heads of their audiences, and some of them, like Rubinstein and Tchaikovsky, were forced to succumb to western influences. However, stronger men, like Moussorgsky, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakoff, cut loose from the debilitating influences of the upper classes, and drew power for their compositions from the folk songs in which the Russian people voiced their aspirations. These two lines of development, one rooted in the sophisticated music of Western Europe, the other in native popular music, persisted throughout Russian compositions up to [1914]. By that time Russian music began to achieve a synthesis of the two strains in the musical symbolism of Scriabine, the gay experiments of Stravinsky and the neo-classicism of Prokofiev.

On the eve of the World War the leading Russian composers were known throughout the civilized world. The works of Moussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Borodin, Glazounov, Stravinsky, Scriabine, and Prokofiev were performed in European and American cities. Russia possessed a rich musical tradition. The Revolution of [1917] found the musical intellectuals unprepared to grasp the significance of the historic change. Composers like Racbmaninov, Stravinsky, Prokofiev, and Medtner; conductors like Koussevitsky; pianists like Orlov and Borovsky; singers like Chaliapin remained abroad. Some of these attempted to work under the Soviet régime, but the musical world was weakened for a time by the civil war and the famine. At the same time, the Revolution created an immense musical audience which demanded the best possible concerts. To satisfy this mass demand for music, the Commissariat of Education created a special department which rapidly organized orchestras, singers' troupes and concerts.

The new audience of Red Army soldiers, students, and workers were not satisfied, however, with the old pot-pourri type of program, making a hash of opera selections, western classics, and Russian music from Glinka to Prokofiev. There arose a need for a new repertoire and a musical content more in accord with the new times. There was a demand for songs and orchestral pieces suitable for the great revolutionary openair festivals. The earliest efforts in this direction were made by the Proletkult, a workers' organization for encouraging a specifically proletarian culture. Later Moscow saw the organization of the Composers' Association, which sought to express the Revolution in music. At present the State Publishing House issues many new musical compositions, and has the collaboration not only of the talented musical youth, but also of older composers like G. Krein, Gliere, and Gnessin.

While encouraging new Revolutionary music, the Soviet Government felt the necessity of continuing the rich heritage of the past and making it accessible to the people of Russia. Operas and concerts throughout the country bring to the worker and peasant the compositions of Glinka, RimskyKorsakoff, Moussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Borodin, Stravinsky and Prokofiev, as well as the German, French and Italian classics. The Moscow, Leningrad and Odessa opera houses flourish on a subscription basis. Many of these subscriptions are taken by trade unions which distribute the tickets among workers. Symphony orchestras have developed in workers' clubs from Moscow to the remotest provinces. Moscow, Tiflis, Leningrad, Odessa and other cities celebrated the Beethoven festival with splendid concerts. An interesting development has been the growth of leaderless orchestras.

The attempt to find new expression for the Revolution in the opera and ballet has taken two directions. The Leningrad opera bases itself on contemporary music, on the conviction that only contemporary music is fit for the new audience. It specializes in Schreker's "Distant Bells," Strauss's "Salome," Prokofiev's "Love of the Three Oranges," and the ballets of Stravinsky and Kshennick. On the other hand, the Bolshoi Theater, with its branches, deeply rooted as it had been in the imperial régime, moved much more slowly toward modernism. It revived and tried to improve its productions of Boris Godunoff, Faust, Carmen, Lohengrin and similar classics. It attempted to make up for its conservative repertoire by modern staging and by re-writing the librettos.

While giving excellent productions of old and new classics, the Soviet opera has experienced great difficulty in creating new operas reflecting the Revolution in music. Several were indeed produced in Leningrad and Moscow, but none of them went beyond the experimental stage. The situation is a little better in the Caucasus, where the Soviet Government's policy toward the culture of minor nationalities gave rise to the first native operas of that region. Two musical dramas by the Georgian composer N. Palishvili scored considerable success, while the Armenian composer N. Spenderyantz is working toward the creation of a national form. New Turkish operas have been performed in Baku, while in the Ukraine the native composers Yanovsky and Zolotaryev are working on national themes.

The era of peace and reconstruction following the civil war permitted the successful development of new concert music, reflecting the new social order. N. Myaskovsky has composed three symphonies of a high order. Myaskovsky is a musical descendant of Glazounov. The influence of the Eastern sections of the Soviet Union is felt in the compositions of Gliere, who has developed Turkoman melodies and more recently prepared a ballet with Chinese musical themes. The Jewish composer, Alexander Krein, has composed a symphony remarkable for its wealth of melody and harmony, while Mikhail Gnessin, another Jewish composer, has written a number of sketches paying tribute to those who perished in the cause of the Revolution. The compositions of N. A. Roslavets attempt to express the collective will of the people by organizing tonal elements independent of emotional significance.

Among the new composers who are influenced by the neoromanticism of Medtner are Anatole Alexandrov; while the influences of Scriabine and modern western expressionism are discernible in the compositions of Polovinkin, Shirinsky, Protopopov, Knipper, Kryukov, Mosolov and Shebalin. The traditions of Ravel and Debussy, mixed with strong oriental influences, are continued by Gregory Krein.

A group of excellent Leningrad composers, educated in the traditions of Rimsky-Korsakoff, Moussorgsky, Borodin and Glazounov, has produced the neo-classic composer of symphonies Shestakovitch and the extreme modernist Shcherbachov. A moderate style characterizes the compositions of Steinberg and Weisberg. One of the few who still compose for the organ is Kushnarev, who calls himself a polyphonist; while Dyeshovy has made some daring experiments in the opera and ballet.

Museums.- There are some 500 museums in the Soviet Union, maintained by the Federal, State or local authorities. These include scientific and historical museums as well as museums devoted to art.

The art museums became greatly enriched as a result of the Revolution. Upwards of 200,000 objects of art, formerly stored in private collections or buried in storehouses, became public property. During the past few years the museums have been renovated and extended and the exhibits rearranged. The first comprehensive inventory of the country's objects of art has been undertaken.

Among the principal museums are the following:

Moscow: The Tretiakov Gallery, including Russian paintings of great historical and artistic value. First Museum of Modern Western Painting, containing the former collection of S. I. Shchukin, one of the finest modern collections in the world. Second Museum of Modern Western Painting, containing the former collection of I. A. Morozov. Museum of the Revolution, a historical arrangement portraying the struggle for freedom in Russia.

Leningrad: Hermitage Museum, Russian Museum, Stroganov Palace, Sheremetiev Villa, Palace of Art (including Museum of the Revolution).

Other museums include: Museum of Ukrainian Art, Kharkov; Museum of Art, Kiev; The Book Museum and the First, Second and Third National Museums of Art in Odessa.

SCIENCE

THE dignity and authority of the scientist has immensely increased in the Soviet State as compared with his position as a court dependent under the old régime. During the years of civil strife and starvation following the October Revolution the scientific worker suffered deplorable hardships. With the economic recovery he has found his place. Under the new integration of society research and discovery have advanced rapidly. The scientist is regarded as the pioneer of material achievement. His laboratory holds the secrets of progress. The governmental appropriations for scientific work to-day are far beyond the subsidies given in the days of Tsarism. Notable work is being done in many fields, especially in the domain of applied science. Through the aid of the scientists the Soviet Union has inaugurated the manufacture of such complicated machines as airplanes and tractors, and large turbines, things never before produced in Russia. Better use of fuels, improved processes of manufacture and the use of newlyrevealed natural resources are constantly being opened as the result of scientific study.

ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.- The activity of the Academy consists principally in studying the natural productive forces of the country, in geographical and ethnographical investigations principally within the country, in the organization of exploratory expeditions, in the development of laboratories and in the organization of the system of museums and scientific exhibitions, which are linked with the Soviet system of education. The Academy is connected with 1,700 local geographic ethnographic societies. During the first decade after the Revolution, ending November, [1927], it organized 300 exploratory exhibitions.

The forty-two active members of the Academy are at the head of sixty scientific institutions and participate in the work of eighty others. They occupy thirty chairs in various universities. The number of academicians is shortly to be increased to eighty-five.

The annual publications of the Academy have averaged some 10,500,000 words of recent years. The Government has appropriated funds for a further expansion of the Academy's publishing activities.

The expansion of the work of the Academy is strikingly revealed by its physical growth. The modest quarters in Leningrad, which served in the pre-Revolutionary days, have been replaced by a whole settlement of buildings and museums. The physiological laboratory of the old days has become the Physiological Institute under the direction of Academician I. P. Pavlov. Along with this a whole list of institutes have blossomed forth. These include the Physio-Mathematical Institute (physics, mathematics, seismics), the Platinum Institute, the Institute of PhysioChemical Analysis, the Dokutchayev Soil Institute, named after the father of Russian soil science, which maintains a splendid soil museum; the Japhetic Institute, which conducts linguistic work along new lines, the Biological Laboratory.

The Academy has established many important commissions, among them a commission known as KEPS, for the study of the natural productive forces of the country; another for the study of the racial composition of the country, which is making cultural reports of great value in regard to the various nationalities and has produced valuable ethnographic maps; a committee, called KISAR, for the study of the federated and autonomous republics, which has made 280 expeditionary surveys, in the course of which groups of young people in the various republics receive a practical initiation in scientific exploration and research.

The preparation of dictionaries is the special province of the Department of Humanistic Sciences of the Academy. In addition to a dictionary of the Russian language, during the past decade the Academy has published dictionaries of Yakut, Persian, Ossetian, Middle Iranian, Protoasiatic and Finnish. The Academy has helped construct alphabets and systems of orthography for remote, primitive peoples that had none, and has taken a prominent part in the movement to Latinize the alphabets in the languages of a number of Eastern peoples in the U.S.S.R. It also prepared the reform of the Russian alphabet, inaugurated in the early days of the Soviet State.

The Academy is preparing four Soviet encyclopedias, general, technical, medical and legal.

Among the humanistic studies of the Academy orientology has a special place. The Asiatic Museum, over a century old, is a center of oriental research. The studies include the Caucasus, Central Asia, Mongolia, India and the Far East, and embrace not only the language and culture, but the natural and historical aspects of oriental development. The organizations participating in these studies include the Japhetic Institute, the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography, the KEPS, the Turcological Institute and the Institute of Buddhist Culture.

The older museums of the Academy, including the Geo logical, Mineralogical, Anthropological and Ethnographic Museums, and Pushkin House, which is now the Museum ol the new Russian Literature, have all been greatly extended and enriched of recent years and have attained great scientifl and educational significance.

The Academy is also in large measure the custodian of th historical, cultural and artistic treasures of the country. Thesi are carefully preserved and are also open to the widest popula study. The library of the Academy in Leningrad, with it 4,500,000 volumes, is one of the largest in the world. Th' Academy's catalogues and scientific publications are increasingly extensive. The Academy celebrated its two hundredth anniversary in [1925].

GEOLOGICAL COMMITTEE.- The Geological Committee was organized in 1882. Since [1920] its work has expanded rapidly. Before the war its budget amounted to $480,000. In [1926] it was $3,200,000. Its staff of permanent employees had increased from 153 in [1913] to 964 in [1926]. In [1924] the number of its prospecting parties was 93, in [1926] it was 136, in [1927] over 200.

In addition to its work of geological surveying, the Committee has undertaken to make a complete inventory of the available mineral resources of the country. Of late it has organized a special branch to take charge of its vast collection of specimens from every part of the country, and for the creation of a museum of regional and applied geology, with provisions for research work.

In the search for new deposits the main purpose is to find new sources of copper, polymetallic ores, oil and certain nonmetallic substances which formerly had to be imported, namely potash, bauxite, asbestos, sulphur, mica. Its discovery of great deposits of potash in the Solikamsk district of the West Ural region in [1926] is of great economic significance. The headquarters of the Committee is at Leningrad, and it has branches in eight cities.

SCIENTIFIC TECHNICAL INSTITUTES.- The following institutes working in applied science, all organized since the Revolution, have done much work to improve productive processes during recent years:

Karpov Chemical Institute of Moscow, especially work on peat and coal tar products, and questions of factory technique. 
State Institute of Applied Chemistry in Leningrad, especially work on methods of improving technological processes and quality of output. 
Moscow Institute of Pure Technical Reagents, has elaborated methods for obtaining 240 reagents and preparations formerly obtained from Germany. 
Scientific Chemico-Pharmaceutical Institute, producing complicated medical preparations never before produced in Russia. 
State Experimental Electro-Technical Institute of Moscow, especially working out improved types of motors. 
Leningrad Experimental Electro-Technical Laboratory, investigates various practical problems of the electro-technical industry. 
Nizhni-Novgorod Radio Laboratory, engaged in improving radio technique. 
Central Aero-Hydro-Dynamic Institute of Professor Zhukovsky, develops wind motors and conducts research in hydraulics and aeronautics. 
Scientific Auto-Motor Institute, develops light motors for automobiles, tractors and airplanes. 
Institute of Applied Mineralogy and Metallurgy, has done much work for the utilization of metals.

For the purpose of better utilization of materials and improved processes in production, a number of special scientific institutions have been founded in the various branches of industry. These include:

State Ceramic Research Institute. 
Textile Research Institute. 
Silicate Experimental Institute. 
Central Institute of the Tobacco Industry. 
Central Institute of the Sugar Industry. 
Experimental Station and Scientific Research Institute of the Leather Industry. 
Experimental Station of the State Paper Industry. 
Institute of the Fishing Industry. 
State Scientific Research Institute of the Oil Industry. 
Institute of the Peat Industry. 
Leningrad Institute of Oil-Driven Motors. 
Thermo-technical Institute.

SOCIETY FOR CULTURAL RELATIONS

THE All-Union Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries was formed for the purpose of establishing closer relations between cultural and scientific bodies in the Soviet Union and those of foreign countries. It arranges the exchange of information, reports, periodicals and books issued by such societies in the Soviet Union for similar publications in foreign countries, and it issues weekly bulletins setting forth various phases of scientific and cultural progress. The Society maintains a Service Bureau for Foreign Visitors, which assists foreigners who go to the Soviet Union for purposes of research or study, and arranges tours for visiting professors, scientists, etc. Madame 0. D. Kameneva is President of the Society. The address is Malaia Nikitskaia, No. 6, Moscow, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. During [1926] a branch of the Society was established at Leningrad, the seat of great art collections and of the Academy of Sciences. The address is Ulitza Khalturina, No. Leningrad, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Reciprocal societies for the promotion of cultural relations with the U.S.S.R. have been formed in various countries.

The exchange of books on cultural and technical subjects with learned societies, universities and Government departments in foreign countries has reached considerable proportions. In [1927] the Society received 81,347 volumes from correspondent organizations abroad and sent in return 82,616 volumes. The United States stood first among countries on the exchange list and Germany second. From organizations in the United States 48,101 volumes were received, nearly 60 per cent of the total, and 18,572 volumes were sent to organizations in the United States.

During the first nine months of [1928] the Society exchanged nearly 160,000 volumes with foreign countries, of which 88,125 volumes were received and 69,242 were sent. Of these 41,040 volumes were received from the United States and 19,400 volumes were sent to the United States.

An affiliated organization, the American Society for Cultural Relations with Russia (USSR), was organized in [1927]. It maintains a headquarters at 49 East 25th Street, New York City. Its membership includes some of the most distinguished figures in arts and professions in American life. A list of its officers and committees follows:

WOMEN IN U.S.S.R.

IN the Soviet State women have the same rights and privileges as men in all social and political matters, in respect to property rights and in respect to equal pay for equal work. Many women hold high executive posts in public life, especially in cultural and health activities. Many women are members of boards of directors of trusts, or serve as directors or assistant directors of factories.

In the elections of [1927] for the rural Soviets 6,500,000 women took part.

In the elections of [1927] for the urban Soviets 22,221 women were elected, or 21.5 per cent of the total number of delegates elected. In [1924] women made up 19.9 per cent of the delegates elected.

In [1927] there were 641 women chairmen of village Soviets in R.S.F.S.R., 17 in White Russia, 48 in the other Constituent Republics (according to incomplete data).

Percentage of women delegates in All-Union Congresses of Soviets: First 3.5 per cent, Second 3.8 per cent, Third 7.1 per cent, Fourth (April, [1927]) 8.2 per cent. In the Fourth Congress the women delegates numbered 193.

In the laws regulating domestic life the woman's rights are in every respect the same as those of the man. The wife's property is her own, and marriage settlements which affect her property rights are invalid. Marriage has no effect on the citizenship of either party. A wife does not have to follow her husband to another place of residence.

Special laws - such as that providing for an adequate vacation period with pay for women in industry before and after childbirth - are designed for the protection of women as mothers and for the protection of their young offspring. Institutions for the protection of mothers and babies, which were rarities before the war, are constantly on the increase. They are supported partly by the State, partly by local effort, and a constant educational propaganda in their favor is maintained by the authorities. The growth of such institutions is shown in the following table, which refers to the R.S.F.S.R. alone:

RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS

THE rights of foreign nationals, where an agreement exists between their government and the U.S.S.R., are regulated in accordance with the terms of that agreement. If the rights of foreigners have not been specified in the agreement or by special laws, the rights of these foreigners to move freely in the territory of the U.S.S.R., to choose a profession, to open and to carry on business enterprises, to acquire movable or immovable property, or shares on land, may be restricted by decrees of the competent central organs of the Government of the U.S.S.R., with the consent of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. Foreign joint-stock companies, associations, and others, acquire the rights of a juridical person only by special government permission.

Foreign firms and foreigners are not allowed to own, or to be part owners, of ships navigating under the Soviet flag, or of joint-stock companies possessing such ships. Exception is made with regard to mixed companies if such rights have been conceded in their statutes or by special decrees.

Foreign vessels are not allowed to engage in coasting trade between the ports of the U.S.S.R. They may be allowed to do coasting trade by way of concession, and only for a single journey, in cases where the Government is interested in it.

Foreign firms desiring to carry on trade operations or to open offices, agencies, etc., in the U.S.S.R., must make application, with payment of the established stamp duty, to the Commissariat for Trade and Commerce, giving all particulars of the proposed enterprise, including management, ownership and proof of legal existence in the country of domicile, of the applicant firm.

Under a legislative measure confirmed by the Central Executive Committee, June, [1925], foreigners have the right to the use of land for agricultural purposes on the same basis as citizens.

Under a decree of the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars, of September 3, [1926], all foreigners residing upon Soviet territory are divided into two categories: (1) temporary residents; (2) foreigners permanently domiciled in the Union.

Domiciled foreigners are defined as those who for a period of not less than 18 months have lawfully resided in the Union and have been engaged in any lawful industry or business. (This provision, however, does not apply to nationals of States which do not extend the privileges of permanent domicile to citizens of the U.S.S.R.).

All foreigners residing in Union territory and not coming under the above provision are regarded as having a temporary residence.

Naturalization

Application for naturalization of foreigners residing in the territory of the U.S.S.R. must be addressed to the administrative department of the Presidium of the Provincial Executive Committee at the place of residence of the applicant, or, if abroad, to the Plenipotentiary of the Diplomatic Mission, for the Presidium of the Union Central Executive Committee. The application must be made on specially provided forms. Wives cannot be entered in the application of the husband, but have to make separate application. Children under 16 should be included preferably in the application of the mother. Children over 16 must make separate application. Applications have to be accompanied by documents proving the identity of the applicant, his nationality, whether the applicant is married or single and any other documents supporting the statements made in the application, as well as a biography.

In the case of citizens abroad being granted citizenship of the U.S.S.R., the applicant has to obtain a passport from the Consulate General within two months of the receipt of the decision.

Any foreigner living abroad who, according to the national laws of his country of origin, does not lose his former nationality by assuming citizenship of the U.S.S.R. must, before being admitted, affix a certificate to the application testifying that there is no objection on the part of his Government to his adopting citizenship of the U.S.S.R.

Visas

In the absence of normal diplomatic relations between the United States and the U.S.S.R., Americans who wish to obtain visas for the U.S.S.R. should communicate with the Visa Department, People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Moscow, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, stating all relevant facts, including purpose of visit, approximate time and at what Soviet consulate they wish to call for their visa. A person whose visit is primarily for scientific or other cultural purpose would do well also to communicate with the Society for Cultural Relations. Americans traveling in Europe may receive information about visas from any Soviet consulate.

The Society for Cultural Relations publishes a comprehensive and compact Guide Book to the Soviet Union, in English, which is available for distribution in the United States and can be obtained in all book stores.
